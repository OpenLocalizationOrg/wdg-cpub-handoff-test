Before a user can repurchase a consumable product, your app or service must report the consumable product as fulfilled for that user.\n\nThere are two ways you can use this method to report a consumable product as fulfilled:\n\n-   Provide the item ID of the consumable (as returned in the **itemId** parameter of a [query for products](query-for-products.md)), and a unique tracking ID that you provide. If the same tracking ID is used for multiple tries, the same result will be returned even if the item is already consumed. If you aren't certain if a consume request was successful, your service should resubmit consume requests with the same tracking ID. The tracking ID will always be tied to that consume request and can be resubmitted indefinitely.\n-   Provide the product ID (as returned in the **productId** parameter of a [query for products](query-for-products.md)) and a transaction ID that is obtained from one of the sources listed in the description for the **transactionId** parameter in the request body section below.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n\nTo use this method, you will need:\n\n-   An Azure AD access token that was created with the **https://onestore.microsoft.com** audience URI.\n-   A Windows Store ID key that was generated by calling the [**GetCustomerCollectionsIdAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt608674) method from client-side code in your app.\n\nFor more information, see [View and grant products from a service](view-and-grant-products-from-a-service.md).\n\n## Request\n\n\n### Request syntax\n\n| Method | Request URI                                                   |\n|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| POST   | https://collections.mp.microsoft.com/v6.0/collections/consume |\n\n \n\n### Request header\n\n| Header         | Type   | Description                                                                                           |\n|----------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Authorization  | string | Required.
