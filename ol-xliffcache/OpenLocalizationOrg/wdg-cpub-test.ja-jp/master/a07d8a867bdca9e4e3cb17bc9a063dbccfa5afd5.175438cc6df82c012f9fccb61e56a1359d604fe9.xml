Now you can migrate rendering code with shadow volumes to DirectX 11, and the Direct3D 11 renderer will be downlevel compatible with feature level 9 devices. This walkthrough shows how any Direct3D 11 app or game can implement traditional shadow volumes using depth testing. The code covers the following process:\n\n1.  Creating Direct3D device resources for shadow mapping.\n2.  Adding a rendering pass to create the depth map.\n3.  Adding depth testing to the main rendering pass.\n4.  Implementing the necessary shader code.\n5.  Options for fast rendering on downlevel hardware.\n\nUpon completing this walkthrough, you should be familiar with how to implement a basic compatible shadow volume technique in Direct3D 11 that's compatible with feature level 9\\_1 and above.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n\nYou should [Prepare your dev environment for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) DirectX game development](prepare-your-dev-environment-for-windows-store-directx-game-development.md). You don't need a template yet, but you'll need Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 to build the code sample for this walkthrough.\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n**Direct3D**\n\n* [Writing HLSL Shaders in Direct3D 9](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/bb944006)\n* [Create a new DirectX 11 project for UWP](user-interface.md)\n\n**Shadow mapping technical articles**\n\n* [Common Techniques to Improve Shadow Depth Maps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee416324)\n* [Cascaded Shadow Maps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee416307)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
