The comments should also provide sufficient constraint information on the resource, so that translation does not break the software. Optionally, the comments can be logged by the Makepri.exe tool.\n\n**XAML:** Resw files (resources created in Visual Studio for apps using XAML) have a comment element.

While this example would appear to work for the English language, it will not work in all cases for the corresponding sentence in German. Notice that in the following German sentences, some of the words in the template string (\"Der\", \"Die\", \"Das\") need to match the parameterized word:\n\n| English                                    | German                                           |\n|:------------------------------------------ |:------------------------------------------------ |\n| The appointment could not be synchronized. | Der Termin konnte nicht synchronisiert werden.   |\n| The task could not be synchronized.        | Die Aufgabe konnte nicht synchronisiert werden.  |\n| The document could not be synchronized.    | Das Dokument konnte nicht synchronisiert werden. |\n\n \n\nAs another example, consider the sentence \"Remind me in {0} minute(s).\" While using \"minute(s)\" works for the English language, other languages might use different terms.

Resource identifiers don't change, but the actual values of the resources do change depending on the language.\n\nBe sure to use meaningful resource identifiers to provide additional context for translation.\n\nDon't change the resource identifiers after the string resources are sent to translation. Localization teams use the resource identifier to track additions, deletions, and updates in the resources. Changes in resource identifiers—also known as \"resource identifiers shift\"—require strings to be retranslated, because it will appear as though strings were deleted and others added.\n\n## <span id=\"choose_an_appropriate_translation_approach.\"></span><span id=\"CHOOSE_AN_APPROPRIATE_TRANSLATION_APPROACH.\"></span>Choose an appropriate translation approach.\n\n\nAfter strings are separated into resource files, they can be translated. The ideal time to translate strings is after the strings in your project are finalized, which usually happens toward the end of a project. You can approach the translation process in number of ways. This may depend on the volume of strings to be translated, the number of languages to be translated, and how the translation will be done (such as in-house versus hiring an external vendor).\n\nConsider the following options:\n\n-   **The resource files can be translated by opening them directly in the project.** This approach works well for a project that has a small volume of strings and that needs to be translated into two or three languages. It could be suitable for a scenario where a developer speaks more than one language and is willing to handle the translation process. This approach benefits by being quick, requires no tools, and minimizes the risk of mistranslations, but it is not scalable. In particular, the resources in different languages can easily get out of sync, causing bad user experiences and maintenance headaches.\n-   **The string resource files are in XML or ResJSON text format, so could be handed off for translation using any text editor. The translated files would then be copied back into the project.** This approach carries a risk of translators accidentally editing the XML tags, but it lets translation work take place outside of the Microsoft Visual Studio project. This approach could work well for projects that need to be translated into a small number of languages. The XLIFF format is an XML format specifically designed for use in localization, and should be well supported by some localization vendors or localization tools. You can use the [Multilingual App Toolkit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/jj572370.aspx) to generate XLIFF files from other resource files, such as .resw or .resjson.\n\nHandoffs to localizers may need to occur for other files, such as images or audio files. Typically, we don't recommend creating culturally dependent files because they can be difficult to localize.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following suggestions:\n\n-   **Use a localization tool.** A number of localization tools are available for parsing resource files and allowing only the translatable strings to be edited by translators. This approach reduces the risk of a translator accidentally editing the XML tags. But it has the drawback of introducing a new tool and process to the localization process. A localization tool is good for projects with a large volume of strings, but a small number of languages. To learn more, see [How to use the Multilingual App Toolkit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/jj572370.aspx).\n-   **Use a localization vendor.** Consider using a localization vendor if your project contains a large volume of strings and needs to be translated for many languages. A localization vendor can give advice about tools and processes, as well as translating your resource files. This is an ideal solution, but is also the most costly option, and may increase the turnaround time for your translated content.\n-   **Keep your localizers informed.** Inform localizers of strings that can be considered a noun or a verb. Explain fabricated words to your localizers by using terminology tools. Keep strings grammatically correct, unambiguous, and as nontechnical as possible to avoid confusion.\n\n## <span id=\"keep_access_keys_and_labels_consistent.\"></span><span id=\"KEEP_ACCESS_KEYS_AND_LABELS_CONSISTENT.\"></span>Keep access keys and labels consistent.\n\n\nIt is a challenge to \"synchronize\" the access keys used in accessibility with the display of the localized access keys, because the two string resources are categorized in two separate sections. Be sure to provide comments for the label string such as: `Make sure that the emphasized shortcut key  is synchronized with the access key.`\n\n**HTML:**\n\nYou can follow the implementation shown below. Again, be sure to properly comment the label string to link it to the access key definition.\n\n```HTML\n<label id=\"theLabel\" data-win-res=\"{accessKey: 'theLabelAccessKey'}\" for=\"xPrinterRedirection\" accessKey=\"L\">The <u>L</u>abel</label>\n<input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"OFF\" id=\"xPrinterRedirection\" name=\"xPrinterRedirection\" />\n```\n\n## <span id=\"support_furigana_for_japanese_strings_that_can_be_sorted.\"></span><span id=\"SUPPORT_FURIGANA_FOR_JAPANESE_STRINGS_THAT_CAN_BE_SORTED.\"></span>Support Furigana for Japanese strings that can be sorted.\n\n\nJapanese Kanji characters have the unique property of having more than one pronunciation depending on the word and context they are used in. This leads to problems when you try to sort Japanese named objects, such as application names, files, songs, and so on. Japanese Kanji have, in the past, usually been sorted in a machine-understandable order called XJIS. Unfortunately, because this sorting order is not phonetic it is not very useful for humans.\n\nFurigana works around this problem by allowing the user or creator to specify the phonetics for the characters they are using. If you use the following procedure to add Furigana to your app name, you can ensure that it is sorted in the proper location in the app list. If your app name contains Kanji characters and Furigana is not provided when the user’s UI language or the sort order is set to Japanese, Windows makes its best effort to generate the appropriate pronunciation. However, there is a possibility for app names containing rare or unique readings to be sorted under a more common reading instead. Therefore, the best practice for Japanese applications (especially those containing Kanji characters in their names) is to provide a Furigana version of their app name as part of the Japanese localization process.\n\n1.  Add \"ms-resource:Appname\" as the Package Display Name and the Application Display Name.\n2.  Create a ja-JP folder under strings, and add two resource files as follows:\n\n    ``` syntax\n    strings\\\n        en-us\\\n        ja-jp\\\n            Resources.altform-msft-phonetic.resw\n            Resources.resw\n    ```\n\n3.  In Resources.resw for general ja-JP: Add a string resource for Appname \"希蒼\"\n4.  In Resources.altform-msft-phonetic.resw for Japanese furigana resources: Add Furigana value for AppName \"のあ\"\n\nThe user can search for the app name \"希蒼\" using both the Furigana value \"のあ\" (noa),　and the phonetic value (using the **GetPhonetic** function from Input Method Editor (IME)) \"まれあお\" (mare-ao).\n\nSorting follows the **Regional Control Panel** format:\n\n-   Under Japanese user locale,\n    -   If Furigana is enabled, the \"希蒼\" is sorted under \"の\".\n    -   If Furigana is missing, the \"希蒼\" is sorted under \"ま\".\n-   Under non-Japanese user locale,\n    -   If Furigana is enabled, the \"希蒼\" is sorted under \"の\".\n    -   If Furigana is missing, the \"希蒼\" is sorted under \"漢字\".\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n* [Globalization and localization do's and don'ts](guidelines-and-checklist-for-globalizing-your-app.md)\n* [Put UI strings into resources](put-ui-strings-into-resources.md)\n* [How to name resources using qualifiers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh965324)\n \n"}
