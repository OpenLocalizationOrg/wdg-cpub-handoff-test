**Descriptions** section of the [app submission process](app-submissions.md) is where you provide the text and [images](app-screenshots-and-images.md) that customers will see in your app's Store listing.\n\nUnlike the rest of the info in your app's submission, you can't access the **Descriptions** step until you [upload your app packages](upload-app-packages.md). This is because we need to detect which [languages](supported-languages.md) your app supports. We'll add a page for you to provide your **Description** info for each language supported by your app. You must complete the **Description** page for at least one language, though we recommend providing them for each language supported by your app. To specify whether or not you will provide a description for each language supported in your app's packages, click **Manage languages**.\n\nMany of the fields in the **Description** are optional, but we suggest providing multiple images and as much info as possible to make your listing stand out. The minimum required for the **Description** step to be considered complete is a text description and at least one [screenshot](app-screenshots-and-images.md).\n\nBy default, we'll use the same description (per language) for all of your targeted operating systems. If you'd like to use a customized description for a specific operating system, you can [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md).\n\n## Default description fields\n\n\nAt the top of the **Description** page, we show you the fields associated with your **Default description**. These fields will be shown to all of your customers, unless you [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md). If you do so, you'll see these fields repeated under section headings for each targeted OS for which you've created a platform-specific description, underneath your **Default description** (which will be displayed to customers on Windows 10, as well as customers on any OS that your app supports for which you haven't created a custom description).

You may include up to 20 features.\n\n**Note**  These will appear bulleted in the listing, so don't add your own bullets.\n\n \n\n### Recommended hardware\n\nDescribe the hardware configurations that your app requires to work properly. This is especially important if your app requires hardware that might not be available on every computer. They are displayed to the customer as a bulleted list in your app's listing.
