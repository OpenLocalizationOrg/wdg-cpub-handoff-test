This topic applies to C\\# and Visual Basic only.\n\n \n\nThe garbage collector determines when to run by balancing the memory consumption of the managed heap with the amount of work a garbage collection needs to do. One of the ways the garbage collector does this is by dividing the heap into generations and collecting only part of the heap most of the time. There are three generations in the managed heap:\n\n-   Generation 0. This generation contains newly allocated objects unless they are 85KB or larger, in which case they are part of the large object heap. The large object heap is collected with generation 2 collections. Generation 0 collections are the most frequently occurring type of collection and clean up short-lived objects such as local variables.\n-   Generation 1. This generation contains objects that have survived generation 0 collections. It serves as a buffer between generation 0 and generation 2. Generation 1 collections occur less frequently than generation 0 collections and clean up temporary objects that were active during previous generation 0 collections. A generation 1 collection also collects generation 0.\n-   Generation 2. This generation contains long-lived objects that have survived generation 0 and generation 1 collections. Generation 2 collections are the least frequent and collect the entire managed heap, including the large object heap which contains objects that are 85KB or larger.\n\nYou can measure the performance of the garbage collector in 2 aspects: the time it takes to do the garbage collection, and the memory consumption of the managed heap. If you have a small app with a heap size less than 100MB then focus on reducing memory consumption. If you have an app with a managed heap larger than 100MB then focus on reducing the garbage collection time only. Here's how you can help the .NET garbage collector achieve better performance.\n\n## Reduce memory consumption\n\n### Release references\n\nA reference to an object in your app prevents that object, and all of the objects it references, from being collected. The .NET compiler does a good job of detecting when a variable is no longer in use so objects held onto by that variable will be eligible for collection. But in some cases it may not be obvious that some objects have a reference to other objects because part of the object graph might be owned by libraries your app uses. To learn about the tools and techniques to find out which objects survive a garbage collection, see [Garbage collection and performance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/ee851764.aspx).\n\n### Induce a garbage collection if it’s useful\n\nInduce a garbage collection only after you have measured your app's performance and have determined that inducing a collection will improve its performance.\n\nYou can induce a garbage collection of a generation by calling [**GC.Collect(n)**]https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/y46kxc5e.aspx), where n is the generation you want to collect (0, 1, or 2).\n\n**Note**  We recommend that you don't force a garbage collection in your app because the garbage collector uses many heuristics to determine the best time to perform a collection, and forcing a collection is in many cases an unnecessary use of the CPU. But if you know that you have a large number of objects in your app that are no longer used and you want to return this memory to the system, then it may be appropriate to force a garbage collection. For example, you can induce a collection at the end of a loading sequence in a game to free up memory before gameplay starts.\n \nTo avoid inadvertently inducing too many garbage collections, you can set the [**GCCollectionMode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/bb495757.aspx) to **Optimized**. This instructs the garbage collector to start a collection only if it determines that the collection would be productive enough to be justified.\n\n## Reduce garbage collection time\n\nThis section applies if you've analyzed your app and observed large garbage collection times. Garbage collection-related pause times include: the time it takes to run a single garbage collection pass; and the total time your app spends doing garbage collections. The amount of time it takes to do a collection depends on how much live data the collector has to analyze. Generation 0 and generation 1 are bounded in size, but generation 2 continues to grow as more long-lived objects are active in your app. This means that the collection times for generation 0 and generation 1 are bounded, while generation 2 collections can take longer. How often garbage collections run depends mostly on how much memory you allocate, because a garbage collection frees up memory to satisfy allocation requests.\n\nThe garbage collector occasionally pauses your app to perform work, but doesn't necessarily pause your app the entire time it is doing a collection. Pause times are usually not user-perceivable in your app, especially for generation 0 and generation 1 collections. The [Background garbage collection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/ee787088.aspx#background-garbage-collection) feature of the .NET garbage collector allows Generation 2 collections to be performed concurrently while your app is running and will only pause your app for short periods of time. But it is not always possible to do a Generation 2 collection as a background collection. In that case, the pause can be user-perceivable if you have a large enough heap (more than 100MB).\n\nFrequent garbage collections can contribute to increased CPU (and therefore power) consumption, longer loading times, or decreased frame rates in your application. Below are some techniques you can use to reduce garbage collection time and collection-related pauses in your managed UWP app.\n\n### Reduce memory allocations\n\nIf you don’t allocate any objects then the garbage collector doesn’t run unless there is a low memory condition in the system. Reducing the amount of memory you allocate directly translates to less frequent garbage collections.\n\nIf in some sections of your app pauses are completely undesirable, then you can pre-allocate the necessary objects beforehand during a less performance-critical time.
