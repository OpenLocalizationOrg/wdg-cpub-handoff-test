The following diagrams show some of the supported finger positions for the rotation interaction.\n\n![diagram demonstrating various finger postures supported by rotation.](images/ux-rotate-positions.png)\n\n**Note**  \nIntuitively, and in most cases, the rotation point is one of the two touch points unless the user can specify a rotation point unrelated to the contact points (for example, in a drawing or layout application). The following images demonstrate how the user experience can be degraded if the rotation point is not constrained in this way.\n\nThis first picture shows the initial (thumb) and secondary (index finger) touch points: the index finger is touching a tree and the thumb is touching a log.\n\n![image showing the two initial touch points for the rotation gesture.](images/ux-rotate-points1.png)\nIn this second picture, rotation is performed around the initial (thumb) touch point. After the rotation, the index finger is still touching the tree trunk and the thumb is still touching the log (the rotation point).\n\n![image showing a rotated picture with the rotation point constrained to one of the two initial touch points.](images/ux-rotate-points2.png)\nIn this third picture, the center of rotation has been defined by the application (or set by the user) to be the center point of the picture. After the rotation, because the picture did not rotate around one of the fingers, the illusion of direct manipulation is broken (unless the user has chosen this setting).\n\n![image showing a rotated picture with the rotation point constrained to the center of the picture rather than either of the two initial touch points.](images/ux-rotate-points3.png)\nIn this last picture, the center of rotation has been defined by the application (or set by the user) to be a point in the middle of the left edge of the picture. Again, unless the user has chosen this setting, the illusion of direct manipulation is broken in this case.\n\n![image showing a rotated picture with the rotation point constrained to the leftmost center of the picture rather than either of the two initial touch points.](images/ux-rotate-points4.png)\n\n \n\nWindows 8 supports three types of rotation: free, constrained, and combined.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Type</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">Free rotation</td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Free rotation enables a user to rotate content freely anywhere in a 360 degree arc.
