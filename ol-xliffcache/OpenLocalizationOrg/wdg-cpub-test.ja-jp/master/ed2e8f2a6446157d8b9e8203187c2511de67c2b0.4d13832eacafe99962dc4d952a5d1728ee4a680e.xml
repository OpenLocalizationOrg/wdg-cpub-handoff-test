This limited the variety of possible payment solutions by other merchants or developers that are not coupled with MNOs. In Windows 10 Mobile, we have introduced a new card emulation technology called, Host Card Emulation (HCE). HCE technology allows your app to directly communicate with an NFC card reader. This topic illustrates how Host Card Emulation (HCE) works on Windows 10 Mobile devices and how you can develop an HCE app so that your customers can access your services through their phone instead of a physical card without collaborating with an MNO. |\n| [Get battery information](get-battery-info.md) | Learn how to get detailed battery information using APIs in the [<strong>Windows.Devices.Power</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn895017) namespace. |\n"}
