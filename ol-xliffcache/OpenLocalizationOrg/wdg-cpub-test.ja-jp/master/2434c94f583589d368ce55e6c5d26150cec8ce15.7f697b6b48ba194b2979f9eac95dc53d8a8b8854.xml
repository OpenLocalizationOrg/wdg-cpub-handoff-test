Typically, this window also displays the location of the configuration log. View the log and make a note of its location so you can refer to it later.\n\nThe path to the log might contain a hidden folder. For example, in the following path, AppData is a hidden folder.\n\nC:\\\\Users\\\\*currentUser*\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\Microsoft\\\\DriverTest\\\\Install\n\nThe log file will have a name similar to this:\n\nDriver Test Computer Configuration 20121115130459167.log\n\n<span id=\"domain_the_network_path_was_not_found\"></span><span id=\"DOMAIN_THE_NETWORK_PATH_WAS_NOT_FOUND\"></span>Provisioning fails: The network path was not found\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you start to provision a target computer, you might see a message that says **The network path was not found**.\n\nOn the target computer, make sure that you have turned on **Network Discovery** and that you have turned on **File and Printer Sharing** for the appropriate network profile. For example, if the host and target computers are joined to a network domain, you must turn on network discovery and file and printer sharing for the **Domain** network profile. For more information, see [Provision a computer for driver deployment and testing (WDK 8.1)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Dn745909).\n\nMake sure you can ping the target computer from the host computer. On the host computer, open a Command Prompt window, and enter **ping** *targetComputerName*, where *targetComputerName* is the name of the target computer.\n\n**Note**  \nYou might see several messages before you see the message **The network path was not found**. Some of those messages might make you think that the network path was found and the first steps of provisioning were succeeding. In fact, the network path was not found and no portion of provisioning succeeded. For example, you might see this:\n\n \n\n``` syntax\nConnecting to computer \"MyComputer\"\nInstalling driver test automation service\nGetting computer system information\nCopying driver test automation files\nThe network path was not found.\n```\n\n<span id=\"domain_the_network_name_cannot_be_found\"></span><span id=\"DOMAIN_THE_NETWORK_NAME_CANNOT_BE_FOUND\"></span>Provisioning fails: The network name cannot be found\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you start to provision a target computer, you might see a message that says **The network name cannot be found**. Double check the name of the target computer. If the computer name you entered originally was incorrect, start the provisioning wizard again (**Driver &gt; Test &gt; Configure Computers)**. Select the incorrect computer name, and click **Next**. For **Computer name**, enter the correct name of the target computer, and complete the wizard.\n\n**Note**  \nYou might see several messages before you see the message **The network name cannot be found**.
