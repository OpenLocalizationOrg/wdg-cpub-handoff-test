C++)\n\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nThis topic shows how to define the activation experience for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) DirectX app.\n\n## Register the app activation event handler\n\n\nFirst, register to handle the [**CoreApplicationView::Activated**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225018) event, which is raised when your app is started and initialized by the operating system.\n\nAdd this code to your implementation of the [**IFrameworkView::Initialize**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700495) method of your view provider (named **MyViewProvider** in the example):\n\n```cpp\nvoid App::Initialize(CoreApplicationView^ applicationView)\n{\n    // Register event handlers for the app lifecycle. This example includes Activated, so that we\n    // can make the CoreWindow active and start rendering on the window.\n    applicationView->Activated +=\n        ref new TypedEventHandler<CoreApplicationView^, IActivatedEventArgs^>(this, &App::OnActivated);\n  \n  //...\n\n}\n```\n\n## Activate the CoreWindow instance for the app\n\n\nWhen your app starts, you must obtain a reference to the [**CoreWindow**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208225) for your app. **CoreWindow** contains the window event message dispatcher that your app uses to process window events. Obtain this reference in your callback for the app activation event by calling [**CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701589). Once you have obtained this reference, activate the main app window by calling [**CoreWindow::Activate**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208254).\n\n```cpp\nvoid App::OnActivated(CoreApplicationView^ applicationView, IActivatedEventArgs^ args)\n{\n    // Run() won't start until the CoreWindow is activated.\n    CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread()->Activate();\n}\n```\n\n## Start processing event message for the main app window\n\n\nYour callbacks occur as event messages are processed by the [**CoreDispatcher**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208211) for the app's [**CoreWindow**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208225). This callback will not be invoked if you do not call [**CoreDispatcher::ProcessEvents**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208215) from your app's main loop (implemented in the [**IFrameworkView::Run**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700505) method of your view provider).\n\n``` syntax\n// This method is called after the window becomes active.\nvoid App::Run()\n{\n    while (!m_windowClosed)\n    {\n        if (m_windowVisible)\n        {\n            CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread()->Dispatcher->ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessAllIfPresent);\n\n            m_main->Update();\n\n            if (m_main->Render())\n            {\n                m_deviceResources->Present();\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            CoreWindow::GetForCurrentThread()->Dispatcher->ProcessEvents(CoreProcessEventsOption::ProcessOneAndAllPending);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Related topics\n\n\n* [How to suspend an app (DirectX and C++)](how-to-suspend-an-app-directx-and-cpp.md)\n* [How to resume an app (DirectX and C++)](how-to-resume-an-app-directx-and-cpp.md)\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
