This enables them to be independently maintained, localized, and customized for different scaling factors, accessibility options, and a number of other user and machine contexts.</p>\n<p>Separate string resources from your app's code to create a single language-independent codebase. Always separate strings from app code and markup, and place them into a resource file, like a ResW or ResJSON file.</p>\n<p>Use the resource infrastructure in Windows to handle the selection of the most appropriate resources to match the user's runtime environment.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Isolate other localizable resource files.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Take other files that require localization, like images that contain text to be translated or that need to be changed due to cultural sensitivity, and place them in folders tagged with language names.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Set your default language, and mark all of your resources, even the ones in your default language.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Always set the default language for your apps appropriately in the app manifest (package.appxmanifest). The default language determines the language that's used when the user doesn't speak any of the supported languages of the app. Mark default language resources, for example en-us/Logo.png, with their language, so the system can tell which language the resource is in and how it's used in particular situations.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Determine the resources of your app that require localization.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>What needs to change if your app is to be localized for other markets? Text strings require translation into other languages. Images may need to be adapted for other cultures. Consider how localization affects other resources that your app uses, like audio or video.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Use resource identifiers in the code and markup to refer to resources.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Instead of having string literals or specific file names for images in your markup, use references to the resources. Be sure to use unique identifiers for each resource. For more info, see [<strong>How to name resources using qualifiers</strong>](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/Hh965324).</p>\n<p>Listen for events that fire when the system changes and it begins to use a different set of qualifiers. Reprocess the document so that the correct resources can be loaded.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Enable text size to increase.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Allocate text buffers dynamically, since text size may expand when translated. If you must use static buffers, make them extra-large (perhaps doubling the length of the English string) to accommodate potential expansion when strings are translated. There also may be limited space available for a user interface. To accommodate localized languages, ensure that your string length is approximately 40% longer than what you would need for the English language. For really short strings, such as single words, you may needs as much as 300% more space. In addition, enabling multiline support and text-wrapping in a control will leave more space to display each string.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Support mirroring.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Text alignment and reading order can be left-to-right, as in English, or right-to-left (RTL), as in Arabic or Hebrew. If you are localizing your product into languages that use a different reading order than your own, be sure that the layout of your UI elements supports mirroring. Even items such as back buttons, UI transition effects, and images may need to be mirrored.</p>\n<p>For more info, see [<strong>Adjust layout and fonts, and support RTL</strong>](adjust-layout-and-fonts--and-support-rtl.md).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Comment strings.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Ensure that strings are properly commented, and only the strings that need to be translated are provided to localizers. Over-localization is a common source of problems.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Use short strings.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Shorter strings are easier to translate and enable translation recycling. Translation recycling saves money because the same string isn't sent to the localizer twice.</p>\n<p>Strings longer than 8192 characters may not be supported by some localization tools, so keep string length to 4000 or less.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Provide strings that contain an entire sentence.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Provide strings that contain an entire sentence, instead of breaking the sentence into individual words, because the translation of words may depend on their position in a sentence. Also, don't assume that a phrase with multiple parameters will keep those parameters in the same order for every language.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Optimize image and audio files for localization.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Reduce localization costs by avoiding use of text in images or speech in audio files. If you're localizing to a language with a different reading direction than your own, using symmetrical images and effects make it easier to support mirroring.</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Don't re-use strings in different contexts.</p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Don't re-use strings in different contexts, because even simple words like &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; may be translated differently, depending on the context.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related articles\n\n\n**Samples**\n* [Application resources and localization sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=254478)\n* [Globalization preferences sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231608)\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
