Every app can have useful or interesting information to show on the tile, even if that content only changes after the user launches and interacts with the app. Local notifications are also a good way to keep the app tile current, even if you also use one of the other notification mechanisms. For instance, a photo app tile could show photos from a recently added album.\n\nWe recommended that your app update its tile locally on first launch, or at least immediately after the user makes a change that your app would normally reflect on the tile. That update isn't seen until the user leaves the app, but by making that change while the app is being used ensures that the tile is already up-to-date when the user departs.\n\nWhile the API calls are local, the notifications can reference web images. If the web image is not available for download, is corrupted, or doesn't meet the image specifications, tiles and toast respond differently:\n\n-   Tiles: The update is not shown\n-   Toast: The notification is displayed, but with a placeholder image\n\nAlthough local notifications don't expire, it's a best practice to set an explicit expiration time.\n\nFor more information, see these topics:\n\n-   [Send a local tile notification](tiles-and-notifications-sending-a-local-tile-notification.md)\n-   [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) notifications code samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Notifications)\n\n## <span id=\"Scheduled_notifications\"></span><span id=\"scheduled_notifications\"></span><span id=\"SCHEDULED_NOTIFICATIONS\"></span>Scheduled notifications\n\n\nScheduled notifications are the subset of local notifications that can specify the precise time when a tile should be updated or a toast notification should be shown. Scheduled notifications are ideal in situations where the content to be updated is known in advance, such as a meeting invitation. If you don't have advance knowledge of the notification content, you should use a push or periodic notification.\n\nBy default, scheduled notifications expire three days from the time that they are delivered. If needed, you can override this default with an explicit expiration time.\n\nFor more information, see these topics:\n\n-   [Guidelines for scheduled notifications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh761464)\n-   [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) notifications code samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Notifications)\n\n## <span id=\"Periodic_notifications\"></span><span id=\"periodic_notifications\"></span><span id=\"PERIODIC_NOTIFICATIONS\"></span>Periodic notifications\n\n\nPeriodic notifications give you live tile updates with a minimal cloud service and client investment. They are also an excellent method of distributing the same content to a wide audience. Your client code specifies the URL of a cloud location that Windows polls for tile or badge updates, and how often the location should be polled. At each polling interval, Windows contacts the URL to download the specified XML content and display it on the tile.\n\nPeriodic notifications require the app to host a cloud service, and this service will be polled at the specified interval by all users who have the app installed. Note that periodic updates cannot be used for toast notifications; toast notifications are best served by scheduled or push notifications.\n\nBy default, periodic notifications expire three days from the time that the polling occurs. If needed, you can override this default with an explicit expiration time.\n\nFor more information, see these topics:\n\n-   [Periodic notification overview](tiles-and-notifications-periodic-notification-overview.md)\n-   [Universal Windows Platform (UWP) notifications code samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/Notifications)\n\n## <span id=\"Push_notifications\"></span><span id=\"push_notifications\"></span><span id=\"PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS\"></span>Push notifications\n\n\nPush notifications are ideal to communicate real-time data or data that is personalized for your user.

Push notifications are also useful in situations where the data is time-sensitive in a way that would not suit periodic notifications, such as sports scores during a game.\n\nPush notifications require a cloud service that manages push notification channels and chooses when and to whom to send notifications.\n\nBy default, push notifications expire three days from the time that they are received by Windows Push Notification Services (WNS).
