Windows Platform (UWP) app's package manifest to access certain API or resources like pictures, music, or devices like the camera or the microphone.\n---\n# App capability declarations\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nCapabilities must be declared in your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app's [package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211474) to access certain API or resources like pictures, music, or devices like the camera or the microphone.\n\nYou request access to specific resources or API by declaring capabilities in your app's [package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211474). You can declare general capabilities by using the [Manifest Designer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/br230259.aspx) in Microsoft Visual Studio, or you can add them manually. For more information, see [How to specify capabilities in a package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211477). It is important to know that when customers get your app from the Store, they're notified of all the capabilities that the app declares. Avoid declaring capabilities that your app doesn't need.\n\nSome capabilities provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource*. These resources are considered sensitive because they can access the user's personal data or cost the user money. Privacy settings, managed by the Settings app, let the user dynamically control access to sensitive resources. Thus, it's important that your app doesn't assume a sensitive resource is always available. For more info about accessing sensitive resources, see [Guidelines for privacy-aware apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh768223). Capabilities that provide apps with access to a *sensitive resource* are annotated by an asterisk (\\*) next to the capability scenario.\n\nThis article reviews four categories of capabilities described below.\n\n-   General-use capabilities that apply to most common app scenarios.\n\n-   Device capabilities that allow your app to access peripheral and internal devices.\n\n-   Special-use capabilities that require a special company account for submission to the Store to use them. For more info about company accounts, see [Account types, locations, and fees](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/JJ863494).\n\n-   Restricted capabilities that are only available to Microsoft and its partners.\n\n## General-use capabilities\n\nGeneral-use capabilities apply to the most common app scenarios.\n\n<table>\n        <thead>\n            <tr>\n                <th>Capability scenario</th>\n                <th>Capability usage</th>\n            </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>**Music***</td>\n                <td>\n                    The **musicLibrary** capability provides programmatic access to the user's Music, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction.

This capability is typically used in movie-playback apps that make use of the entire Videos library.\n\n                    The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app. Declare the **videosLibrary** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the **file picker**.\n\n                    The **videosLibrary** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.\n                    <table>\n                        <thead>\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>XML</th>\n                            </tr>\n                        </thead>\n                        <tbody>\n                            <tr>\n                                <td>\n<pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;\n    &lt;uap:Capability Name=\"videosLibrary\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre>\n                                </td>\n                            </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>**Removable Storage**</td>\n                <td>\n                    The **removableStorage** capability provides programmatic access to files on removable storage, like USB keys and external hard drives, filtered to the file-type associations declared in the package manifest. For example, if a document-reader app declares a .doc file-type association, it can open .doc files on the removable storage device, but not other types of files. Be careful when you declare this capability, because users may include a variety of info in their removable storage devices, and will expect your app to provide a valid justification for programmatic access to the removable storage for all files of the declared type.\n\n                    Users will expect your app to handle any file associations that you declare. So don't declare file associations that your app cannot handle responsibly. The [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847) provides a robust UI mechanism that lets users open files for use with an app.\n\n                    Declare the **removableStorage** capability only when the scenarios for your app require programmatic access and can't be realized by using the [**file picker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR207847).\n\n                    The **removableStorage** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.\n                    <table>\n                        <thead>\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>XML</th>\n                            </tr>\n                        </thead>\n                        <tbody>\n                            <tr>\n                                <td>\n<pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;\n    &lt;uap:Capability Name=\"removableStorage\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre>\n                                </td>\n                            </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>**Internet and public networks***</td>\n                <td>\n                    There are two capabilities that provide different levels of access to the Internet and public networks.\n\n                    The **internetClient** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Cannot act as a server. No local network access.\n\n                    The **internetClientServer** capability indicates that apps can receive incoming data from the Internet. Can act as a server. No local network access.\n\n                    Most apps that have a web service component will use **internetClient**. Apps that enable peer-to-peer (P2P) scenarios where the app needs to listen for incoming network connections should use **internetClientServer**. The **internetClientServer** capability includes the access that the **internetClient** capability provides, so you don't need to specify **internetClient** when you specify **internetClientServer**.\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>**Homes and work networks***</td>\n                <td>\n                    The **privateNetworkClientServer** capability provides inbound and outbound access to home and work networks through the firewall. This capability is typically used for games that communicate across the local area network (LAN), and for apps that share data across a variety of local devices. If your app specifies **musicLibrary**, **picturesLibrary**, or **videosLibrary**, you don't need to use this capability to access the corresponding library in a Home Group. On Windows, this capability does not provide access to the Internet.\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>**Appointments**</td>\n                <td>\n                    The **appointments** capability provides access to the user’s appointment store. This capability allows read access to appointments obtained from the synced network accounts and to other apps that write to the appointment store. With this capability, your app can create new calendars and write appointments to calendars that it creates.\n\n                    The **appointments** capability must include the **uap** namespace when you declare it in your app's package manifest as shown below.\n                    <table>\n                        <thead>\n                            <tr>\n                                <th>XML</th>\n                            </tr>\n                        </thead>\n                        <tbody>\n                            <tr>\n                                <td>\n<pre><code>&lt;Capabilities&gt;\n    &lt;uap:Capability Name=\"appointments\"/&gt;\n&lt;/Capabilities&gt;</code></pre>\n                                </td>\n                            </tr>\n                        </tbody>\n                    </table>\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>**Contacts***</td>\n                <td>\n                    The **contacts** capability provides access to the aggregated view of the contacts from various contacts stores.

Device capabilities are specified by using the **DeviceCapability** element in your app package manifest. This element may require additional child elements and some device capabilities need to be added to the package manifest manually. For more info, see [How to specify device capabilities in a package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263092) and [**DeviceCapability Schema reference**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211430).\n\n| Capability scenario | Capability usage |\n|---------------------|------------------|\n| **Location**\\* | The **location** capability provides access to location functionality that is retrieved from dedicated hardware like a GPS sensor in the PC or is derived from available network info. Apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled location services from the **Settings** charm. |\n| **Microphone** | The **microphone** capability provides access to the microphone’s audio feed, which allows the app to record audio from connected microphones. Apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled the microphone from the **Settings** charm. |\n| **Proximity** | The **proximity** capability enables multiple devices in close proximity to communicate with one another. This capability is typically used in casual multi-player games and in apps that exchange information. Devices attempt to use the communication technology that provides the best possible connection, including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and the Internet. This capability is used only to initiate communication between the devices. |\n| **Webcam** | The **webcam** capability provides access to the video feed of a built-in camera or external webcam, which allows the app to capture photos and videos. On Windows, apps must handle the case in which the user has disabled the camera from the **Settings** charm.<br/>The **webcam** capability only grants access to the video stream. In order to grant access to the audio stream as well, the **microphone** capability must be added. | \n| **USB** | The **usb** device capability enables access to APIs in the [Updating the app manifest package for a USB device](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302259). | \n| **Human interface device (HID)** | The **humaninterfacedevice** device capability enables access to APIs in the [How to specify device capabilities for HID](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263091). |\n| **Point of Sevice (POS)** | The **pointOfService** device capability enables access to APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.PointOfService**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn298071) namespace. This namespace lets your app access Point of Service (POS) barcode scanners and magnetic stripe readers. The namespace provides a vendor-neutral interface for accessing POS devices from various manufacturers from a Windows Store app. |\n| **Bluetooth** | The **bluetooth** device capability allows apps to communicate with already paired bluetooth devices over both Generic Attribute (GATT) or Classic Basic Rate (RFCOMM) protocol.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263413) namespace. |\n| **Wi-Fi Networking** | The **wiFiControl** device capability allows apps to scan and connect to Wi-Fi networks.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.WiFi**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn975224) namespace. |\n| **Radio state** | The **radios** device capability allows apps to toggle the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios.<br/>This capability is required to use the APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Radios**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn996447) namespace.  |\n| **Optical disc** | The **optical** device capability allows apps to access functions on optical disk drives such as CD, DVD, and Blu-ray.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Custom**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263667) namespace. |\n| **Motion activity** | The **activity** device capability allows apps to detect the current motion of the device.<br/>This capability is required to use some APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Sensors**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR206408) namespace. |\n\n## Special and restricted capabilities\n\n**Important**  \nSpecial and restricted capabilities are intended for very specific scenarios. The use of these capabilities is highly restricted and subject to additional Store onboarding policy and review.\n\nThere are cases where such capabilities are necessary and appropriate, such as banking with two-factor authentication, where users provide a smart card with a digital certificate that confirms their identity. Other apps may be designed primarily for enterprise customers and may need access to corporate resources that cannot be accessed without the user’s domain credentials.\n\nApps that apply the special-use capabilities require a company account to submit them to the Store. In contrast, restricted capabilities do not require a special company account for the Store, they are not available for developers to use. Restricted capabilities are available only to apps that are developed by Microsoft and its partners.
