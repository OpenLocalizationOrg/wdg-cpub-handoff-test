556BC70D-CF5D-4295-A655-D58163CC1824\nlabel: Tabs and pivots\ntemplate: detail.hbs\n---\n# Tabs and pivots\n\nTabs and pivots are used for navigating frequently accessed, distinct content categories. The tab/pivot pattern is made of two or more content panes that have corresponding category headers. The headers persist on-screen and have a selection state that's clearly shown, so users are always aware of which category they're in.\n![An examples of tabs](images/HIGSecOne_Tabs.png)\n\nTabs and pivots are effectively the same pattern, and both are built using the [**Pivot**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.aspx) control. The basic functionality of the Pivot control is described later in this article.\n\n<span class=\"sidebar_heading\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Important APIs</span>\n\n-   [**Pivot class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn608241)\n\n## The tab/pivot pattern\n\nWhen building an app with the tab/pivot pattern, there are a few key design variables to consider based on the pattern's configurable feature set.\n\n- **Header placement.**   Headers can be placed at the top or the bottom of the screen.\n    \n    **Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing headers at the bottom of the screen requires re-templating the Pivot control.\n- **Header labels.**  Headers can have an icon with text, text only, or icon only.\n- **Header alignment.**  Headers can be left-justified or centered.\n- **Top-level or sub-level navigation.**  Tabs/pivots can be used for either level of navigation, and can be stacked in a top-level/sub-level pattern. When there are two levels of tabs/pivots, the top-level and sub-level headers should have enough visual differentiation so that users can clearly separate the two.\n- **Touch gesture support.**  For devices that support touch gestures, you can use one of two interaction sets to navigate between content categories:\n    1. Tap on a tab/pivot header to navigate to that category, or swipe on the content area to navigate to the adjacent category.\n    2. Tap on a tab/pivot header to navigate to that category (no swipe).\n\n### Pattern configurations\n\nThe optimal arrangement of the tab/pivot pattern depends on the interaction scenario and the device(s) on which your app will appear. This table outlines some of the top scenarios and pattern configurations.\n\nInteraction scenario|Recommended configuration\n--------------------|-------------------------\nMoving laterally between 2 to 5 top-level list or grid view content categories on a phone or phablet|Tab/pivots: Placed at the top of the screen, centered\n|Header labels: Icons + text\n|Swipe on content area: Enabled\nMoving between a range of content categories on a phone or phablet in which swiping on a content area isn't practical for navigation|Tab/pivots: Placed at the bottom of the screen, centered\n|Header labels: Icons + text\n|Swipe on content area: Disabled\nTop-level navigation with a mouse and keyboard|Tab/pivots: Placed at the top of the screen, left-aligned\n *or*|Header labels: Text-only\n Page-level navigation on a touch device|Swipe on content area: Disabled\n\n## Examples\n\nThis design of a food truck app shows what placing tab/pivot headers on the top or bottom can look like. On mobile devices, placing them at the bottom works well for reachability.\n\n![An example of tabs on a mobile device](images/uap_foodtruck_phone_320_tabsboth.png)\n\nThe food truck app design on laptop/desktop features text-only headers. Using icons with text for headers helps with touch targeting, but for mouse and keyboard, text-only headers work well.\n\n![Example of tabs on desktop](images/uap_foodtruck_desktop_home_700.png)\n\n## Create a pivot control\n\nThe tab/pivot navigation pattern is built using the [**Pivot**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.aspx) control. The control comes with the basic functionality described in this section.\n\nThis XAML creates a basic pivot control with 3 sections of content.\n\n```xaml\n<Pivot x:Name=\"rootPivot\" Title=\"PIVOT TITLE\">\n    <PivotItem Header=\"Pivot Item 1\">\n        <!--Pivot content goes here-->\n        <TextBlock Text=\"Content of pivot item 1.\"/>\n    </PivotItem>\n    <PivotItem Header=\"Pivot Item 2\">\n        <!--Pivot content goes here-->\n        <TextBlock Text=\"Content of pivot item 2.\"/>\n    </PivotItem>\n    <PivotItem Header=\"Pivot Item 3\">\n        <!--Pivot content goes here-->\n        <TextBlock Text=\"Content of pivot item 3.\"/>\n    </PivotItem>\n</Pivot>\n```\n\n**Pivot items**\n\nPivot is an [**ItemsControl**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.aspx), so it can contain a collection of items of any type. Any item you add to the Pivot that is not explicitly a [**PivotItem**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivotitem.aspx) is implicitly wrapped in a PivotItem. Because a Pivot is often used to navigate between pages of content, it's common to populate the [**Items**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.items.aspx) collection directly with XAML UI elements. Or, you can set the [**ItemsSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.itemssource.aspx) property to a data source. Items bound in the ItemsSource can be of any type, but if they aren't explicitly PivotItems, you must define an [**ItemTemplate**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.itemtemplate.aspx) and [**HeaderTemplate**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.headertemplate.aspx) to specify how the items are displayed.\n\nYou can use the [**SelectedItem**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.selecteditem.aspx) property to get or set the Pivot's active item. Use the [**SelectedIndex**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.selectedindex.aspx) property to get or set the index of the active item. \n\n**Pivot headers**\n\nYou can use the [**LeftHeader**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.leftheader.aspx) and [**RightHeader**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pivot.rightheader.aspx) properties to add other controls to the Pivot header. \n\n### Pivot interaction\n\nThe control features these touch gesture interactions:\n\n-   Tapping on a header navigates to that header's section content.\n-   Swiping left or right on a header navigates to the adjacent header/section.\n-   Swiping left or right on section content navigates to the adjacent header/section.\n\nThe control comes in two modes:\n\n**Stationary**\n\n-   Pivots are stationary when all pivot headers fit within the allowed space.\n-   Tapping on a pivot label navigates to the corresponding page, though the pivot itself will not move. The active pivot is highlighted.\n\n**Carousel**\n\n-   Pivots carousel when all pivot headers don't fit within the allowed space.\n-   Tapping a pivot label navigates to the corresponding page, and the active pivot label will carousel into the first position.\n\nThe control has built-in breakpoint functionality, which is based on the number of headers and the string length of the labels.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n-   Base the alignment of tab/pivot headers on screen size. For screen widths below 720 epx, center-aligning usually works better, while left-aligning for screen widths above 720 epx is recommended in most cases.\n-   When scaling a window, once the number of tabs/pivot headers exceeds available real estate, start pushing headers into the overflow area.\n-   Tabs/pivots can be used in either screen orientation, but be sure to maintain the same total number of headers (visible and hidden) in both landscape and portrait orientations.\n-   Avoid using more than 5 headers when using carousel (round-trip) mode, as having more than 5 can cause the user to lose orientation.\n-   On mobile devices, placing tabs/pivots at the bottom works well for reachability, if swiping is used in another part of the UI, and to avoid top-heavy UI.\n-   When the on-screen keyboard is deployed, headers can move off-screen to preserve space.\n\n\\[This article contains information that is specific to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and Windows 10.
