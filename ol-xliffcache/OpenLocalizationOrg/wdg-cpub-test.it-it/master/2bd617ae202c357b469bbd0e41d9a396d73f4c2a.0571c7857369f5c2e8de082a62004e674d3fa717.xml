10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\\[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released.

It expands on the information that is provided in error messages from [Winmdexp.exe (Windows Runtime Metadata Export Tool)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh925576.aspx), and complements the information on restrictions that is provided in [Creating Windows Runtime Components in C# and Visual Basic](creating-windows-runtime-components-in-csharp-and-visual-basic.md).\n\nThis article doesn’t cover all errors. The errors discussed here are grouped by general category, and each category includes a table of associated error messages. Search for message text (omitting specific values for placeholders) or for message number. If you don’t find the information you need here, please help us improve the documentation by using the feedback button at the end of this article. Include the error message. Alternatively, you can file a bug at the Microsoft Connect website.\n\n## Error message for implementing async interface provides incorrect type\n\n\nManaged Windows Runtime Components cannot implement the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) interfaces that represent asynchronous actions or operations ([IAsyncAction](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/br205781.aspx), [IAsyncActionWithProgress&lt;TProgress&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/br205784.aspx), [IAsyncOperation&lt;TResult&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206598.aspx), or [IAsyncOperationWithProgress&lt;TResult, TProgress&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206594.aspx)). Instead, the .NET Framework provides the [AsyncInfo](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.interopservices.windowsruntime.asyncinfo.aspx) class for generating async operations in Windows Runtime Components. The error message that Winmdexp.exe displays when you try to implement an async interface incorrectly refers to this class by its former name, AsyncInfoFactory. The .NET Framework no longer includes the AsyncInfoFactory class.\n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME1084      | Type '{0}' implements Windows Runtime async interface '{1}'. Windows Runtime types cannot implement async interfaces. Please use the System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.AsyncInfoFactory class to generate async operations for export to Windows Runtime. |\n\n \n\n> **Note** The error messages that refer to the Windows Runtime use an old terminology. This is now referred to as the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). For example, Windows Runtime types are now called UWP types.\n\n \n\n## Missing references to mscorlib.dll or System.Runtime.dll\n\n\nThis issue occurs only when you use Winmdexp.exe from the command line. We recommend that you use the /reference option to include references to both mscorlib.dll and System.Runtime.dll from the .NET Framework core reference assemblies, which are located in \"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\\\Reference Assemblies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Framework\\\\.NETCore\\\\v4.5\" (\"%ProgramFiles%\\\\...\" on a 32-bit computer).\n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME1009      | No reference was made to mscorlib.dll. A reference to this metadata file is required in order to export correctly.                               |\n| WME1090      | Could not determine the core reference assembly. Please make sure mscorlib.dll and System.Runtime.dll is referenced using the /reference switch. |\n\n \n\n## Operator overloading is not allowed\n\n\nIn a Windows Runtime Component written in managed code, you cannot expose overloaded operators on public types.\n\n> **Note** In the error message, the operator is identified by its metadata name, such as op\\_Addition, op\\_Multiply, op\\_ExclusiveOr, op\\_Implicit (implicit conversion), and so on.\n\n \n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                          |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME1087      | '{0}' is an operator overload. Managed types cannot expose operator overloads in the Windows Runtime. |\n\n \n\n## Constructors on a class have the same number of parameters\n\n\nIn the UWP, a class can have only one constructor with a given number of parameters; for example, you can't have one constructor that has a single parameter of type **String** and another that has a single parameter of type **int** (**Integer** in Visual Basic). The only workaround is to use a different number of parameters for each constructor.\n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME1099      | Type '{0}' has multiple constructors with '{1}' argument(s). Windows Runtime types cannot have multiple constructors with the same number of arguments. |\n\n \n\n## Must specify a default for overloads that have the same number of parameters\n\n\nIn the UWP, overloaded methods can have the same number of parameters only if one overload is specified as the default overload. See \"Overloaded Methods\" in [Creating Windows Runtime Components in C# and Visual Basic](creating-windows-runtime-components-in-csharp-and-visual-basic.md).\n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME1059      | Multiple {0}-parameter overloads of '{1}.{2}' are decorated with Windows.Foundation.Metadata.DefaultOverloadAttribute.                                                            |\n| WME1085      | The {0}-parameter overloads of {1}.{2} must have exactly one method specified as the default overload by decorating it with Windows.Foundation.Metadata.DefaultOverloadAttribute. |\n\n \n\n## Namespace errors and invalid names for the output file\n\n\nIn the Universal Windows Platform, all the public types in a Windows metadata (.winmd) file must be in a namespace that shares the .winmd file name, or in sub-namespaces of the file name. For example, if your Visual Studio project is named A.B (that is, your Windows Runtime Component is A.B.winmd), it can contain public classes A.B.Class1 and A.B.C.Class2, but not A.Class3 (WME0006) or D.Class4 (WME1044).\n\n> **Note**  These restrictions apply only to public types, not to private types used in your implementation.\n\n \n\nIn the case of A.Class3, you can either move Class3 to another namespace or change the name of the Windows Runtime Component to A.winmd. Although WME0006 is a warning, you should treat it as an error. In the previous example, code that calls A.B.winmd will be unable to locate A.Class3.\n\nIn the case of D.Class4, no file name can contain both D.Class4 and classes in the A.B namespace, so changing the name of the Windows Runtime Component is not an option. You can either move D.Class4 to another namespace, or put it in another Windows Runtime Component.\n\nThe file system can't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase, so namespaces that differ by case are not allowed (WME1067).\n\nYour component must contain at least one **public sealed** type (**Public NotInheritable** in Visual Basic). If not, you will get WME1042 or WME1043, depending on whether your component contains private types.\n\nA type in a Windows Runtime Component cannot have a name that is the same as a namespace (WME1068).\n\n> **Caution**  If you call Winmdexp.exe directly and don't use the /out option to specify a name for your Windows Runtime Component, Winmdexp.exe tries to generate a name that includes all the namespaces in the component. Renaming namespaces can change the name of your component.\n\n \n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME0006      | '{0}' is not a valid winmd file name for this assembly. All types within a Windows Metadata file must exist in a sub namespace of the namespace that is implied by the file name. Types that do not exist in such a sub namespace cannot be located at runtime.

However, the .NET Framework provides mappings for a number of commonly used types that are slightly different in the .NET Framework and the UWP. This enables the .NET Framework developer to work with familiar types instead of learning new ones. You can use these mapped .NET Framework types in the public interface of your component. See \"Declaring types in Windows Runtime Components\" and \"Passing Universal Windows Platform types to managed code\" in [Creating Windows Runtime Components in C# and Visual Basic](creating-windows-runtime-components-in-csharp-and-visual-basic.md), and [.NET Framework mappings of Windows Runtime types](net-framework-mappings-of-windows-runtime-types.md).\n\nMany of these mappings are interfaces. For example, [IList&lt;T&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5y536ey6.aspx) maps to the UWP interface [IVector&lt;T&gt;](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br206631.aspx). If you use List&lt;string&gt; (`List(Of String)` in Visual Basic) instead of IList&lt;string&gt; as a parameter type, Winmdexp.exe provides a list of alternatives that includes all the mapped interfaces implemented by List&lt;T&gt;. If you use nested generic types, such as List&lt;Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;&gt; (List(Of Dictionary(Of Integer, String)) in Visual Basic), Winmdexp.exe offers choices for each level of nesting. These lists can become quite long.\n\nIn general, the best choice is the interface that is closest to the type. For example, for Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;, the best choice is most likely IDictionary&lt;int, string&gt;.\n\n> **Important**  JavaScript uses the interface that appears first in the list of interfaces that a managed type implements. For example, if you return Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; to JavaScript code, it appears as IDictionary&lt;int, string&gt; no matter which interface you specify as the return type. This means that if the first interface doesn't include a member that appears on later interfaces, that member isn't visible to JavaScript.\n\n> **Caution**  Avoid using the non-generic [IList](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.collections.ilist.aspx) and [IEnumerable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.collections.ienumerable.aspx) interfaces if your component will be used by JavaScript. These interfaces map to [IBindableVector](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.interop.ibindablevector.aspx) and [IBindableIterator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.interop.ibindableiterator.aspx), respectively. They support binding for XAML controls, and are invisible to JavaScript. JavaScript issues the run-time error \"The function 'X' has an invalid signature and cannot be called.\"\n\n \n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Error number</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Message Text</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">WME1033</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Method '{0}' has parameter '{1}' of type '{2}'.

Those fields must be public. Valid field types include enumerations, structures, and primitive types.\n\n| Error number | Message Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WME1060      | Structure '{0}' has field '{1}' of type '{2}'.

Parameters cannot be marked **ref** (**ByRef** without the [OutAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.runtime.interopservices.outattribute.aspx) attribute in Visual Basic). This applies to the contents of arrays, so array parameters must indicate whether the array contents are read-only or write-only. The direction is clear for **out** parameters (**ByRef** parameter with the OutAttribute attribute in Visual Basic), but array parameters that are passed by value (ByVal in Visual Basic) must be marked.

For an example, see the [ReturnValueNameAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/system.runtime.interopservices.windowsruntime.returnvaluenameattribute.aspx) attribute.\n\n| Error number | Message Text |\n|---------------|------------|\n| WME1091 | The method '\\{0}' has the return value named '\\{1}' which is the same as a parameter name.
