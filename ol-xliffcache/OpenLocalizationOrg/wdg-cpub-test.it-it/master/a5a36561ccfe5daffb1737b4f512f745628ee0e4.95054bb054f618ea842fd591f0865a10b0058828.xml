A password box looks like a text input box, except that it renders bullets in place of the text that has been entered.

You don't use a RichEditBox to get user input into you app the way you use other standard text input boxes. Rather, you use it to work with text files that are separate from your app. You typically save text entered into a RichEditBox to a .rtf file.\n\n**Is text input the best option?**\n\nThere are many ways you can get user input in your app. These questions will help answer whether one of the standard text input boxes or another control is the best fit for getting user input.\n\n-   **Is it practical to efficiently enumerate all valid values?** If so, consider using one of the selection controls, such as a [check box](checkbox.md), [drop-down list](lists.md), list box, [radio button](radio-button.md), [slider](slider.md), [toggle switch](toggles.md), [date picker](date-and-time.md), or time picker.\n-   **Is there a fairly small set of valid values?** If so, consider a [drop-down list](lists.md) or a list box, especially if the values are more than a few characters long.\n-   **Is the valid data completely unconstrained? Or is the valid data only constrained by format (constrained length or character types)?** If so, use a text input control. You can limit the number of characters that can be entered, and you can validate the format in your app code.\n-   **Does the value represent a data type that has a specialized common control?** If so, use the appropriate control instead of a text input control. For example, use a [**DatePicker**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211681) instead of a text input control to accept a date entry.\n-   If the data is strictly numeric:\n    -   **Is the value being entered approximate and/or relative to another quantity on the same page?** If so, use a [slider](slider.md).\n    -   **Would the user benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes?** If so, use a [slider](slider.md), possibly with an accompanying control.\n    -   **Is the value entered likely to be adjusted after the result is observed, such as with volume or screen brightness?** If so, use a [slider](slider.md).\n    \n## Examples\n\nText box\n\n![A text box](images/text-box.png)\n\nAuto suggest box\n\n![Example of the expanded auto-suggest control](images/controls_autosuggest_expanded01.png)\n\nPassword box\n\n![Password box focus state typing text](images/passwordbox-focus-typing.png)\n\n## Create a text control\n\nSee these articles for info and examples specific to each text control.\n\n-   [**AutoSuggestBox**](auto-suggest-box.md)\n-   [**PasswordBox**](password-box.md)\n-   [**RichEditBox**](rich-edit-box.md)\n-   [**RichTextBlock**](rich-text-block.md)\n-   [**TextBlock**](text-block.md)\n-   [**TextBox**](text-box.md)\n\n## Font and style guidelines\nSee these articles for font guidelines:\n\n- [**Font guidelines**](fonts.md)\n- [**Segoe MDL2 icon list and guidelines**](segoe-ui-symbol-font.md)\n\n\n## Choose the right keyboard for your text control\n\n**Applies to:** TextBox, PasswordBox RichEditBox\n\nTo help users to enter data using the touch keyboard, or Soft Input Panel (SIP), you can set the input scope of the text control to match the kind of data the user is expected to enter.\n\n>Tip \n>This info applies only to the SIP. It does not apply to hardware keyboards or the On-Screen Keyboard available in the Windows Ease of Access options.\n\nThe touch keyboard can be used for text entry when your app runs on a device with a touch screen. The touch keyboard is invoked when the user taps on an editable input field, such as a TextBox or RichEditBox. You can make it much faster and easier for users to enter data in your app by setting the input scope of the text control to match the kind of data you expect the user to enter. The input scope provides a hint to the system about the type of text input expected by the control so the system can provide a specialized touch keyboard layout for the input type.\n\nFor example, if a text box is used only to enter a 4-digit PIN, set the [InputScope](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textbox.inputscope.aspx) property to **Number**. This tells the system to show the number keypad layout, which makes it easier for the user to enter the PIN.\n\n>Important  \n>The input scope does not cause any input validation to be performed, and does not prevent the user from providing any input through a hardware keyboard or other input device. You are still responsible for validating the input in your code as needed.\n\nFor more info, see [Use input scope to change the touch keyboard]().\n\n## Color fonts\n\n**Applies to:** TextBlock, RichTextBlock, TextBox, RichEditBox\n\nWindows has the ability for fonts to include multiple colored layers for each glyph. For example, the Segoe UI Emoji font defines color versions of the Emoticon and other Emoji characters. \n\nThe standard and rich text controls support display color fonts. By default, the **IsColorFontEnabled** property is **true** and fonts with these additional layers are rendered in color. The default color font on the system is Segoe UI Emoji and the controls will fall back to this font to display the glyphs in color. \n\n```xaml\n<TextBlock FontSize=\"30\">Hello ☺⛄☂♨⛅</TextBlock>\n```\n\nThe rendered text looks like this:\n\n![Text block with color font](images/text-block-color-fonts.png)\n\nFor more info, see the [**IsColorFontEnabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.textblock.iscolorfontenabled.aspx) property.\n\n## Guidelines for line and paragraph separators\n\n**Applies to:** TextBlock, RichTextBlock, multi-line TextBox, RichEditBox\n\nUse the line separator character (0x2028) and the paragraph separator character (0x2029) to divide plain text. A new line is begun after each line separator. A new paragraph is begun after each paragraph separator.\n\nIt isn't necessary to start the first line or paragraph in a file with these characters or to end the last line or paragraph with them; doing so indicates that there is an empty line or paragraph in that location.\n\nYour app can use the line separator to indicate an unconditional end of line. However, line separators do not correspond to the separate carriage return and linefeed characters, or to a combination of these characters. Line separators must be processed separately from carriage return and linefeed characters.\n\nYour app can insert a paragraph separator between paragraphs of text. Use of this separator allows creation of plain text files that can be formatted with different line widths on different operating systems. The target system can ignore any line separators and break paragraphs only at the paragraph separators.\n\n\\[This article contains information that is specific to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and Windows 10.
