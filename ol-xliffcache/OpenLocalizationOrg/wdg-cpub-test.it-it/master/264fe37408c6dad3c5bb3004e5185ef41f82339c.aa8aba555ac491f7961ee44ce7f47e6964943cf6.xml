When you click this link, a popup will appear asking you to choose from your supported targeted operating systems. Windows 10 is not included in the list of choices, because customers on Windows 10 will always see the app's default description.\n\n**Note**  If you haven't provided packages targeting multiple OS versions, or if you've already created platform-specific descriptions for all of the OS versions your app targets, you won't be able to make a selection.\n\n \n\nYou can choose to use your default description as a starting point, which will bring over all of the text and images you've entered for your default description; you'll then be able to make any changes you'd like before saving.\n\nYou can also start from a completely blank description if you prefer.\n\nAfter you click **Continue**, your **Description** page will now include a section for the platform-specific description you've just created (underneath the [Default description](create-app-descriptions.md#default-description-fields) section). This section will include its own set of fields for **Description** (required), **Release notes**, **Screenshots**, **App tile icon**, **App features**, and **Recommended hardware**. Make sure to enter info into each field where you want to display info in the custom description, even if it's the same info as in your default description. If you leave any of these fields blank, no info will appear for that field in the custom description.\n\n**Note**  Not all fields of your app's description can be customized for a specific targeted OS. For more info, see [Shared fields](create-app-descriptions.md#shared-fields).\n\n \n\n## Removing a platform-specific description\n\n\nIf you create a platform-specific description and later decide you'd rather show your default description to customers on that operating system, click the **Delete** link. After confirming that you'd like to show those customers your default description, click **OK**. The platform-specific description will be removed. If you decide you want it back later, you can always create a new platform-specific description for that operating system by following the steps listed above.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
