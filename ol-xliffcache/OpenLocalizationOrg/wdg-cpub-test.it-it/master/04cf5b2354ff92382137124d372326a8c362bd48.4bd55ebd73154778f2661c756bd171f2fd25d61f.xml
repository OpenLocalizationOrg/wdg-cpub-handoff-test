Importantly, you can submit these packages in any order; you are not limited to providing higher-versioned packages with each subsequent submission.\n\nYou can even provide multiple Windows 10 packages with the same version number.

However, for a number of reasons, you might not want to merge existing codebases to create a single project right away.\n\nYou can use the package versioning rules to gradually move your customers to a single package for the Universal device family, while shipping a number of interim updates for specific device families (including ones that take advantage of Windows 10 APIs). The example below illustrates how the same rules are consistently applied.\n\n| Submission | Contents                                                  | Customer experience                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1          | -   Package version: 1.1.10.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Desktop, minVersion 10.0.10240.0 <br> <br> -   Package version: 1.1.0.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Mobile, minVersion 10.0.10240.0     | -   Devices on Windows 10 Desktop build 10.0.10240.0 and above will get 1.1.10.0 <br> -   Devices on Windows 10 Mobile build 10.0.10240.0 and above will get 1.1.0.0 <br> -   Other device families will not be able to purchase and install the app |\n| 2          | -   Package version: 1.1.10.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Desktop, minVersion 10.0.10240.0 <br> <br> -   Package version: 1.1.0.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Mobile, minVersion 10.0.10240.0 <br> <br> -   Package version: 1.0.0.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Universal, minVersion 10.0.10240.0    | -   Devices on Windows 10 Desktop build 10.0.10240.0 and above will get 1.1.10.0 <br> -   Devices on Windows 10 Mobile build 10.0.10240.0 and above will get 1.1.0.0 <br> -   Other (non-desktop, non-mobile) device families when they are introduced will get 1.0.0.0 <br> -   Desktop and mobile devices that already have the app installed will not see any update (because they already have the best available version—1.1.10.0 and 1.1.0.0 are both higher than 1.0.0.0) |\n| 3          | -   Package version: 1.1.10.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Desktop, minVersion 10.0.10240.0 <br> <br> -   Package version: 1.1.5.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Universal, minVersion 10.0.10250.0 <br> <br> -   Package version: 1.0.0.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Universal, minVersion 10.0.10240.0    | -   Devices on Windows 10 Desktop build 10.0.10240.0 and above will get 1.1.10.0 <br> -   Devices on Windows 10 Mobile build 10.0.10250.0 and above will get 1.1.5.0 <br> -   Devices on Windows 10 Mobile build >=10.0.10240.0 and < 10.010250.0 will get 1.1.0.0 \n| 4          | -   Package version: 2.0.0.0 <br> -   Device family: Windows.Universal, minVersion 10.0.10240.0   | -   All customers on all device families on Windows 10 build v10.0.10240.0 and above will get package 2.0.0.0 | \n\n**Note**  In all cases, customer devices will receive the package that has the highest possible version number that they qualify for. For example, in the third submission above, all desktop devices will get v1.1.10.0, even if they have OS version 10.0.10250.0 or higher and thus could also accept v1.1.5.0. Since 1.1.10.0 is the highest version number available to them, that is the package they will get.\n\n \n\n### Using version numbering to roll back to a previously-shipped package for new acquisitions\n\nIf you keep copies of your earlier Windows 10 package files, you'll be able to roll back your app’s package in the Store to an earlier Windows 10 package if you discover problems with a release. This is a temporary way to limit the disruption to your customers while you fix the issue.\n\nTo do this, create a new submission. Remove the problematic package and upload the old package that you want to provide in the Store. Customers who have already received the package you are rolling back will still have the problematic package (since your older package will have an earlier version number). But this will stop anyone else from acquiring the problematic package, while allowing the app to still be available in the Store.\n\nTo fix the issues for the customers who have already received the problematic package, you can submit a new Windows 10 package that has a higher version number than the bad package as soon as you can. After that submission goes through the certification process, all customers will be updated to the new package, since it will have a higher version number.\n\n## Version numbering for Windows 8.1 (and earlier) and Windows Phone 8.1 packages\n\n\nFor .appx packages that target Windows Phone 8.1, the version number of the package in a new submission must always be greater than that of the package included in the last submission (or any previous submission).\n\nFor .appx packages that target Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, the same rule applies per architecture: the version number of the package in a new submission must always be greater than that of the package last shipped to the Windows Store for the same architecture.\n\nAdditionally, the version number of Windows 8.1 packages must always be greater than the version numbers of any of your Windows 8 packages for the same app. In other words, the version number of any Windows 8 package that you submit must be lower than the version number of any Windows 8.1 package that you've submitted for the same app.\n\n**Note**  If you also have Windows 10 packages, the version number of the Windows 10 packages must be higher than those for Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and/or Windows Phone 8.1 packages you are publishing or have published. For more info, see [Adding packages for Windows 10 to a previously-published app](guidance-for-app-package-management.md#adding-packages-for-windows-10-to-a-previously-published-app).\n\n \n\nHere are some examples of what happens in different version number update scenarios for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n| With this version of your app in the Store  | And you upload this version | After the new version is in the Windows Store, this will be installed in a new acquisition | After the new version is in the Windows Store, this will be updated if a customer already has the app |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Nothing                                     | x86, v1.0.0.0               | x86, v1.0.0.0 on both x86 and x64 computers                                                | Nothing. |\n| x86, v1.0.0.0                               | x64, v1.0.0.0               | v1.0.0.0 for the customer's architecture                                                   | Nothing.
