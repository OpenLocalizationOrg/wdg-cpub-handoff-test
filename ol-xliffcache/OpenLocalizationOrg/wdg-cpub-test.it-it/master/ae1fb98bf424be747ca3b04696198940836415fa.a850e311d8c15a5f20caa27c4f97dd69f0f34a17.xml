value either in XAML or in code.\ntitle: Property-path syntax'\nms.assetid: FF3ECF47-D81F-46E3-BE01-C839E0398025\n---\n\n# Property-path syntax\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nYou can use the [**PropertyPath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244259) class and the string syntax to instantiate a **PropertyPath** value either in XAML or in code. **PropertyPath** values are used by data binding. A similar syntax is used for targeting storyboarded animations. But animation targeting doesn't create underlying Property-path syntax values, it keeps the info as a string. For both scenarios, a property path describes a traversal of one or more object-property relationships that eventually resolve to a single property.\n\nYou can set a property path string directly to an attribute in XAML. You can use the same string syntax to construct a [**PropertyPath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244259) that sets a [**Binding**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209820) in code, or to set an animation target in code using [**SetTargetProperty**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210503). There are two distinct feature areas in the Windows Runtime that use a property path: data binding, and animation targeting. Animation targeting doesn't create underlying Property-path syntax values in the Windows Runtime implementation, it keeps the info as a string, but the concepts of object-property traversal are very similar. Data binding and animation targeting each evaluate a property path slightly differently, so we describe property path syntax separately for each.\n\n## Property path for objects in data binding\n\nIn Windows Runtime, you can bind to the target value of any dependency property. The source property value for a data binding doesn't have to be a dependency property; it can be a property on a business object (for example a class written in a Microsoft .NET language or C++). Or, the source object for the binding value can be an existing dependency object already defined by the app. The source can be referenced either by a simple property name, or by a traversal of the object-property relationships in the object graph of the business object.\n\nYou can bind to an individual property value, or you can bind to a target property that holds lists or collections. If your source is a collection, or if the path specifies a collection property, the data-binding engine matches the collection items of the source to the binding target, resulting in behavior such as populating a [**ListBox**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242868) with a list of items from a data source collection without needing to anticipate the specific items in that collection.\n\n### Traversing an object graph\n\nThe element of the syntax that denotes the traversal of an object-property relationship in an object graph is the dot (**.**) character. Each dot in a property path string indicates a division between an object (left side of the dot) and a property of that object (right side of the dot). The string is evaluated left-to-right, which enables stepping through multiple object-property relationships. Let's look at an example:\n\n``` syntax\n<Binding Path=\"Customer.Address.StreetAddress1\"\n```\n\nHere's how this path is evaluated:\n\n1.  The data context object (or a [**Source**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209832) specified by the same [**Binding**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209820)) is searched for a property named \"Customer\".\n2.  The object that is the value of the \"Customer\" property is searched for a property named \"Address\".\n3.  The object that is the value of the \"Address\" property is searched for a property named \"StreetAddress1\".\n\nAt each of these steps, the value is treated as an object. The type of the result is checked only when the binding is applied to a specific property. This example would fail if \"Address\" were just a string value that didn't expose what part of the string was the street address. Typically, the binding is pointing to the specific nested property values of a business object that has a known and deliberate information structure.\n\n### Rules for the properties in a data-binding property path\n\n-   All properties referenced by a property path must be public in the source business object.\n-   The end property (the property that is the last named property in the path) must be public and must be mutable â€“ you can't bind to static values.\n-   The end property must be read/write if this path is used as the [**Path**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209830) information for a two-way binding.\n\n### Indexers\n\nA property path for data-binding can include references to indexed properties. This enables binding to ordered lists/vectors, or to dictionaries/maps. Use square brackets \"\\[\\]\" characters to indicate an indexed property. The contents of these brackets can be either an integer (for ordered list) or an unquoted string (for dictionaries). You can also bind to a dictionary where the key is an integer. You can use different indexed properties in the same path with a dot separating the object-property.\n\nFor example, consider a business object where there is a list of \"Teams\" (ordered list), each of which has a dictionary of \"Players\" where each player is keyed by last name. An example property path to a specific player on the second team is: \"Teams\\[1\\].Players\\[Smith\\]\". (You use 1 to indicate the second item in \"Teams\" because the list is zero-indexed.)\n\n**Note**  Indexing support for C++ data sources is limited; see [Data binding in depth](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt210946).\n\n### Attached properties\n\nProperty paths can include references to attached properties. Because the identifying name of an attached property already includes a dot, you must enclose any attached property name within parentheses so that the dot isn't treated as an object-property step. For example, the string to specify that you want to use [**Canvas.ZIndex**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh759773) as a binding path is \"(Canvas.ZIndex)\". For more info on attached properties see [Attached properties overview](attached-properties-overview.md).\n\n### Combining property path syntax\n\nYou can combine various elements of property path syntax in a single string. For example, you can define a property path that references an indexed attached property, if your data source had such a property.\n\n### Debugging a binding property path\n\nBecause a property path is interpreted by a binding engine and relies on info that may be present only at run-time, you must often debug a property path for binding without being able to rely on conventional design-time or compile-time support in the development tools. In many cases the run-time result of failing to resolve a property path is a blank value with no error, because that is the by-design fallback behavior of binding resolution. Fortunately, Microsoft Visual Studio provides a debug output mode that can isolate which part of a property path that's specifying a binding source failed to resolve. For more info on using this development tool feature, see [\"Debugging\" section of Data binding in depth](../data-binding/data-binding-in-depth.md#debugging).\n\n## Property path for animation targeting\n\nAnimations rely on targeting a dependency property where storyboarded values are applied when the animation runs. To identify the object where the property to be animated exists, the animation targets an element by name ([x:Name attribute](x-name-attribute.md)). It is often necessary to define a property path that starts with the object identified as the [**Storyboard.TargetName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh759823), and ends with the particular dependency property value where the animation should apply. That property path is used as the value for [**Storyboard.TargetProperty**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh759824).\n\nFor more info on the how to define animations in XAML, see [Storyboarded animations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187354).\n\n## Simple targeting\n\nIf you are animating a property that exists on the targeted object itself, and that property's type can have an animation applied directly to it (rather than to a sub-property of a property's value) then you can simply name the property being animated without any further qualification. For example, if you are targeting a [**Shape**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243377) subclass such as [**Rectangle**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243371), and you are applying an animated [**Color**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh673723) to the [**Fill**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243378) property, your property path can be \"Fill\".\n\n## Indirect property targeting\n\nYou can animate a property that is a sub-property of the target object. In other words, if there's a property of the target object that's an object itself, and that object has properties, you must define a property path that explains how to step through that object-property relationship. Whenever you are specifying an object where you want to animate a sub-property, you enclose the property name in parentheses, and you specify the property in *typename*.*propertyname* format. For example, to specify that you want the object value of a target object's [**RenderTransform**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208980) property, you specify \"(UIElement.RenderTransform)\" as the first step in the property path. This isn't yet a complete path, because there are no animations that can apply to a [**Transform**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243006) value directly. So for this example, you now complete the property path so that the end property is a property of a **Transform** subclass that can be animated by a **Double** value: \"(UIElement.RenderTransform).(CompositeTransform.TranslateX)\"\n\n## Specifying a particular child in a collection\n\nTo specify a child item in a collection property, you can use a numeric indexer. Use square brackets \"\\[\\]\" characters around the integer index value. You can reference only ordered lists, not dictionaries. Because a collection isn't a value that can be animated, an indexer usage can never be the end property in a property path.\n\nFor example, to specify that you want to animate the first color stop color in a [**LinearGradientBrush**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210108) that is applied to a control's [**Background**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209395) property, this is the property path: \"(Control.Background).(GradientBrush.GradientStops)\\[0\\].(GradientStop.Color)\". Note how the indexer is not the last step in the path, and that the last step particularly must reference the [**GradientStop.Color**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210094) property of item 0 in the collection to apply a [**Color**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh673723) animated value to it.\n\n## Animating an attached property\n\nIt isn't a common scenario, but it is possible to animate an attached property, so long as that attached property has a property value that matches an animation type. Because the identifying name of an attached property already includes a dot, you must enclose any attached property name within parentheses so that the dot isn't treated as an object-property step. For example, the string to specify that you want to animate the [**Grid.Row**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh759795) attached property on an object, use the property path \"(Grid.Row)\".\n\n**Note**  For this example, the value of [**Grid.Row**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh759795) is an **Int32** property type. so you can't animate it with a **Double** animation. Instead, you'd define an [**ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210320) that has [**DiscreteObjectKeyFrame**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243132) components, where the [**ObjectKeyFrame.Value**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210344) is set to an integer such as \"0\" or \"1\".\n\n## Rules for the properties in an animation targeting property path\n\n-   The assumed starting point of the property path is the object identified by a [**Storyboard.TargetName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh759823).\n-   All objects and properties referenced along the property path must be public.\n-   The end property (the property that is the last named property in the path) must be public, be read-write, and be a dependency property.\n-   The end property must have a property type that is able to be animated by one of the broad classes of animation types ([**Color**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh673723) animations, **Double** animations, [**Point**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225870) animations, [**ObjectAnimationUsingKeyFrames**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br210320)).\n\n## The PropertyPath class\n\nThe [**PropertyPath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244259) class is the underlying property type of [**Binding.Path**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209830) for the binding scenario.\n\nMost of the time, you can apply a [**PropertyPath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244259) in XAML without using any code at all. But in some cases you may want to define a **PropertyPath** object using code and assign it to a property at run-time.\n\n[**PropertyPath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244259) has a [**PropertyPath(String)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244261) constructor, and doesn't have a default constructor. The string you pass to this constructor is a string that's defined using the property path syntax as we explained earlier. This is also the same string you'd use to assign [**Path**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209830) as a XAML attribute. The only other API of the **PropertyPath** class is the [**Path**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244260) property, which is read-only. You could use this property as the construction string for another **PropertyPath** instance.\n\n## Related topics\n\n* [Data binding in depth](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt210946)\n* [Storyboarded animations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187354)\n* [{Binding} markup extension](binding-markup-extension.md)\n* [**PropertyPath**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br244259)\n* [**Binding**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209820)\n* [**Binding constructor**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209825)\n* [**DataContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208713)\n\n"}
