10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nIn Windows 10, significant work was done to create a new unified compositor and rendering engine for all Windows applications, be it desktop or mobile. A result of that work was the unified Composition WinRT API called Windows.UI.Composition that offers access to new lightweight Composition objects along with new Compositor driven Animations and Effects.\n\nWindows.UI.Composition is a declarative, [Retained-Mode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff684178.aspx) API that can be called from any Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Application to create composition objects, animations and effects directly in an application. The API is a powerful supplement to existing frameworks such as XAML to give developers of UWP applications a familiar C# surface to add to their application. These APIs can be used to create DX style framework-less applications.\n\nA XAML developer can “drop down” to the composition layer in C# to do custom work in the composition layer using WinRT to create a “Composition Island” of objects in their XAML application rather than dropping all the way down to the graphics layer and using DirectX and C++ for any custom UI work.\n\n![](images/layers-win-ui-composition.png)\n## <span id=\"Composition_Objects_and_The_Compositor\"></span><span id=\"composition_objects_and_the_compositor\"></span><span id=\"COMPOSITION_OBJECTS_AND_THE_COMPOSITOR\"></span>Composition Objects and The Compositor\n\nComposition objects are created by the [**Compositor**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn706789) which acts as a factory for composition objects. The compositor can create [**Visual**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn706858) objects, which allow for the creation of a visual tree structure on which all other features and Composition objects in the API use and build on.\n\nThe API allows developers to define and create one or many [**Visual**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn706858) objects each representing a single node in a Visual tree.\n\nVisuals can be containers for other Visuals or can host content Visuals.
