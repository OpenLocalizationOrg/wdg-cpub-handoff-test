unenroll a device from SEMM by using a Surface UEFI reset package or the Recovery Request option.\nkeywords: surface enterprise management\nms.prod: w10\nms.mktglfcycl: manage\nms.pagetype: surface, devices, security\nms.sitesec: library\nauthor: jobotto\n---\n\n# Unenroll Surface devices from SEMM\n\nWhen a Surface device is enrolled in Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM), a certificate is stored in the firmware of that device. The presence of that certificate and the enrollment in SEMM prevent any unauthorized changes to Surface UEFI settings or options while the device is enrolled in SEMM. To restore control of Surface UEFI settings to the user, the Surface device must be unenrolled from SEMM, a process sometimes described as reset or recovery. There are two methods you can use to unenroll a device from SEMMâ€”a Surface UEFI reset package and a Recovery Request.\n\n>**Warning:**&nbsp;&nbsp;To unenroll a device from SEMM and restore user control of Surface UEFI settings, you must have the SEMM certificate that was used to enroll the device in SEMM. If this certificate becomes lost or corrupted, it is not possible to unenroll from SEMM. Back up and protect your SEMM certificate accordingly.\n\nFor more information about SEMM, see [Microsoft Surface Enterprise Management Mode](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/surface/surface-enterprise-management-mode).\n\n## Unenroll a Surface device from SEMM with a Surface UEFI reset package\n\nThe Surface UEFI reset package is the primary method you use to unenroll a Surface device from SEMM. Like a Surface UEFI configuration package, the reset package is a Windows Installer (.msi) file that configures SEMM on the device. Unlike the configuration package, the reset package will reset the Surface UEFI configuration on a Surface device to its default settings, remove the SEMM certificate, and unenroll the device from SEMM.\n\nReset packages are created specifically for an individual Surface device. To begin the process of creating a reset package, you will need the serial number of the device you want to unenroll, as well as the SEMM certificate used to enroll the device. You can find the serial number of your Surface device on the **PC information** page of Surface UEFI, as shown in Figure 1. This page is displayed even if Surface UEFI is password protected and the incorrect password is entered.\n\n![Serial number of Surface device is displayed](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig1.png \"Serial number of Surface device is displayed\")\n\n*Figure 1. The serial number of the Surface device is displayed on the Surface UEFI PC information page*\n\n>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;To boot to Surface UEFI, press **Volume Up** and **Power** simultaneously while the device is off. Hold **Volume Up** until the Surface logo is displayed and the device begins to boot.\n\nTo create a Surface UEFI reset package, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator from the Start menu.\n2. Click **Start**.\n3. Click **Reset Package**, as shown in Figure 2.\n\n   ![Select Reset Package to create a package to unenroll Surface device from SEMM](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig2.png \"Select Reset Package to create a package to unenroll Surface device from SEMM\")\n\n   *Figure 2. Click Reset Package to create a package to unenroll a Surface device from SEMM*\n\n4. Click **Certificate Protection** to add your SEMM certificate file with private key (.pfx), as shown in Figure 3. Browse to the location of your certificate file, select the file, and then click **OK**.\n\n   ![Add the SEMM certificate to Surface UEFI reset package](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig3.png \"Add the SEMM certificate to Surface UEFI reset package\")\n\n   *Figure 3. Add the SEMM certificate to a Surface UEFI reset package*\n\n5. Click **Next**.\n6. Type the serial number of the device you want to unenroll from SEMM (as shown in Figure 4), and then click **Build** to generate the Surface UEFI reset package.\n\n   ![Create a Surface UEFI reset package with serial number of Surface device](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig4.png \"Create a Surface UEFI reset package with serial number of Surface device\")\n\n   *Figure 4. Use the serial number of your Surface device to create a Surface UEFI reset package*\n\n7. In the **Save As** dialog box, specify a name for the Surface UEFI reset package, browse to the location where you would like to save the file, and then click **Save**.\n8. When the package generation has completed, the **Successful** page is displayed. Click **End** to complete package creation and close Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator.\n\nRun the Surface UEFI reset package Windows Installer (.msi) file on the Surface device to unenroll the device from SEMM. The reset package will require a reboot to perform the unenroll operation. After the device has been unenrolled, you can verify the successful removal by ensuring that the **Microsoft Surface Configuration Package** item in **Programs and Features** (shown in Figure 5) is no longer present.\n\n![Screen that shows device is enrolled in SEMM](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig5.png \"Screen that shows device is enrolled in SEMM\")\n\n*Figure 5. The presence of the Microsoft Surface Configuration Package item in Programs and Features indicates that the device is enrolled in SEMM*\n\n## Unenroll a Surface device from SEMM with a Recovery Request\n\nIn some scenarios, a Surface UEFI reset package may not be a viable option to unenroll a Surface device from SEMM (for example, where Windows has become unusable). In these scenarios you can unenroll the device by using a Recovery Request generated from within Surface UEFI. The Recovery Request process can be initiated even on devices where you do not have the Surface UEFI password.\n\nThe Recovery Request process is initiated from Surface UEFI on the Surface device, approved with Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator on another computer, and then completed in Surface UEFI. Like the reset package, approving a Recovery Request with Microsoft Surface UEFI Configurator requires access to the SEMM certificate that was used to enroll the Surface device.\n\nTo initiate a Recovery Request, follow these steps:\n\n1. Boot the Surface device that is to be unenrolled from SEMM to Surface UEFI.\n2. Type the Surface UEFI password if you are prompted to do so.\n3. Click the **Enterprise management** page, as shown in Figure 6.\n\n   ![Enterprise Management page](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig6.png \"Enterprise Management page\")\n\n   *Figure 6. The Enterprise management page is displayed in Surface UEFI on devices enrolled in SEMM*\n\n4. Click or press **Get Started**.\n5. Click or press **Next** to begin the Recovery Request process.\n   >**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;A Recovery Request expires two hours after it is created. If a Recovery Request is not completed in this time, you will have to restart the Recovery Request process.\n6. Select **SEMM Certificate** from the list of certificates displayed on the **Choose a SEMM reset key** page (shown in Figure 7), and then click or press **Next**.\n\n   ![Select SEMM certificate for your Recovery Request](images\\surface-semm-unenroll-fig7.png \"Select SEMM certificate for your Recovery Request\")\n\n   *Figure 7. Choose SEMM Certificate for your Recovery Request (Reset Request)*\n\n7.
