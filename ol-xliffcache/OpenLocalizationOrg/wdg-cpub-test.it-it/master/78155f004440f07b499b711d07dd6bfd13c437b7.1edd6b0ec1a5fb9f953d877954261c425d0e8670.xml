Alternatively, you can programmatically retrieve this data by using the [Windows Store analytics REST API](../monetize/access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md).\n\nIn this report, an IAP acquisition means a customer has purchased an IAP from you. Multiple purchases of the same consumable IAP by the same customer are counted as separate IAP acquisitions.\n\n> **Important**  The **IAP acquisitions** report does not include data about refunds, reversals, chargebacks, etc. To estimate your app proceeds, visit [Payout summary](payout-summary.md). In the **Reserved** section, click the **Download reserved transactions** link.\n\n## Apply filters\n\n\nNear the top of the page, you can expand **Apply filters** to filter all of the data on this page by date range and/or by device type.

If you want to show acquisition data for only one of your IAPs, you can choose a specific one here.\n-   **Device type**: The default setting is **All devices**.

By default this will include data for all device types, unless you've used **Apply filters** to choose only one.\n\n## IAP acquisitions\n\n\nThe **IAP acquisitions** chart shows the number of daily or weekly acquisitions of your IAPs over the selected period of time. (When you use **Apply filters** to filter the data over a longer duration, the data will be grouped by week.)\n\nYou can also see the lifetime number of acquisitions for your IAPs. This shows the cumulative total of all acquisitions, starting from when your app was first published.\n\nThe chart also shows the price that a customer paid to acquire the IAP.\n\nYou can optionally filter the results by market and/or by OS version.\n\n## Top IAPs\n\n\nThe **Top IAPs** chart shows the total number of acquisitions for each of your IAPs over the selected period of time by market. By default, we show you the IAP which had the most acquisitions on top and continue downward from there. You can reverse this order by toggling the arrow in the **Acquisitions** column of this chart.\n\n## Markets\n\n\nThe **Markets** chart shows the total number of IAP acquisitions over the selected period of time by market.
