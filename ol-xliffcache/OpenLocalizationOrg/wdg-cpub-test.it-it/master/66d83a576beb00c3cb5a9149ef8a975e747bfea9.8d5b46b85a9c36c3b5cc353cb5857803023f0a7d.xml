The gripper is a combination of two Segoe UI fonts that are available system-wide. Using font resources simplifies rendering issues at different dpi and works well with the various UI scaling plateaus. When implementing your own grippers, they should share the following UI traits:\n\n    -   Circular shape\n    -   Visible against any background\n    -   Consistent size\n-   Provide a margin around the selectable content to accommodate the gripper UI. If your app enables text selection in a region that doesn't pan/scroll, allow a 1/2 gripper margin on the left and right sides of the text area and 1 gripper height on the top and bottom sides of the text area (as shown in the following images). This ensures that the entire gripper UI is exposed to the user and minimizes unintended interactions with other edge-based UI.\n\n    ![text selection gripper margins](images/textselection-gripper-margins.png)\n\n-   Hide grippers UI during interaction. Eliminates occlusion by the grippers during the interaction. This is useful when a gripper isn't completely obscured by the finger or there are multiple text selection grippers. This eliminates visual artifacts when displaying child windows.\n\n-   Don't allow selection of UI elements such as controls, labels, images, proprietary content, and so on. Typically, Windows applications allow selection only within specific controls. Controls such as buttons, labels, and logos are not selectable. Assess whether selection is an issue for your app and, if so, identify the areas of the UI where selection should be prohibited. \n\n## <span id=\"Additional_usage_guidance\"></span><span id=\"additional_usage_guidance\"></span><span id=\"ADDITIONAL_USAGE_GUIDANCE\"></span>Additional usage guidance\n\n\nText selection and manipulation is particularly susceptible to user experience challenges introduced by touch interactions. Mouse, pen/stylus, and keyboard input are highly granular: a mouse click or pen/stylus contact is typically mapped to a single pixel, and a key is pressed or not pressed. Touch input is not granular; it's difficult to map the entire surface of a fingertip to a specific x-y location on the screen to place a text caret accurately.\n\n**Considerations and recommendations**\n\nUse the built-in controls exposed through the language frameworks in Windows to build apps that provide the full platform user interaction experience, including selection and manipulation behaviors.

As with other Windows touch interactions, timed interactions are limited to the press and hold gesture to display informational UI. For more information, see [Guidelines for visual feedback](guidelines-for-visualfeedback.md).\n\nWindows recognizes two possible states for selection interactions, editable and non-editable, and adjusts selection UI, feedback, and functionality accordingly.\n\n**Editable content**\n\nTapping within the left half of a word places the cursor to the immediate left of the word, while tapping within the right half places the cursor to the immediate right of the word.\n\nThe following image demonstrates how to place an initial insertion cursor with gripper by tapping near the beginning or ending of a word.\n\n![tap (or press and hold) left side of a word to place a caret and gripper at the beginning of that word. tap (or press and hold) the right side of a word to place a caret and gripper at the end of that word.](images/textselection-place-caret.png)\n\nThe following image demonstrates how to adjust a selection by dragging the gripper.\n\n![drag the gripper in either direction to adjust selection (the first gripper remains anchored and a second gripper is displayed). drag either gripper to make subsequent adjustments.](images/adjust-selection.png)\n\nThe following images demonstrate how to invoke the context menu by tapping within the selection or on a gripper (press and hold can also be used).\n\n![tap (or press and hold) within the selection or on a gripper to invoke the context menu.](images/textselection-show-context.png)\n\n**Note**  These interactions vary somewhat in the case of a misspelled word.
