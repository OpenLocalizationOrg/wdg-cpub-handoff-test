The emulator is a desktop application that emulates a mobile device running Windows 10. It provides a virtualized environment in which you can debug and test Windows apps without a physical device. It also provides an isolated environment for your application prototypes. |\n| [Beta testing](beta-testing.md) | **Beta testing** gives you the chance to improve your app based on feedback from individuals outside of your app-development team who try your unreleased app on their own devices. |\n| [Windows App Certification Kit](windows-app-certification-kit.md) | To give your app the best chance of being [Windows App Certification Kit](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=309666). |\n| [Performance](performance-and-xaml-ui.md) | Users expect their apps to remain responsive, to feel natural, and not to drain their battery. Technically, performance is a non-functional requirement but treating performance as a feature will help you deliver on your users' expectations. Specifying goals, and measuring, are key factors.
