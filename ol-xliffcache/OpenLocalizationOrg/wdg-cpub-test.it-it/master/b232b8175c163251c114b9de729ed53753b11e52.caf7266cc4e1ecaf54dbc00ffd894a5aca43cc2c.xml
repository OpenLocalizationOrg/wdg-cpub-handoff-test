ratings\nms.assetid: B501A773-517B-4158-8364-C1BE630DC512\n---\n\n# Age ratings\n\nThe **Age ratings** page of the [App submission process](app-submissions.md) lets you provide information about your app so it can receive the appropriate age ratings from the [International Age Ratings Coalition (IARC)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=716854). These ratings are about the suitability of the content in the app and its metadata, rather than the age of the target audience for your app.\n\n## Answering the age ratings questionnaire\n\nThe first time you submit an app (or the first time you update an app that was published using the older age rating process), you will be prompted to take a multiple-choice questionnaire to determine your app’s age rating.\n\n> **Important**  If you have already taken the questionnaire for your app in another storefront and have an IARC rating ID, you can select the option to provide us with your rating ID. We'll use your ID to associate the existing ratings with your app in the Windows Store.\n\nYou are required to answer the questions accurately. As part of this process, we share your publisher display name and email address with IARC. After you complete the questionnaire, IARC will assign age ratings based on your responses. We’ll use these ratings when displaying your app to customers in different markets. You will also receive an email from IARC with info about the app’s ratings.\n\nThe first question asks you to choose the category that best describes your app (and its metadata). Once you make a selection, you will see additional questions. The specific questions you see will vary based on your previous answers. If you make a mistake, you can start the questionnaire again to provide the right answers.\n\nWhen you have completed answering the questions, click **Save and generate**. You’ll then see all of the app’s assigned ratings, and can continue with your submission. You can also click **Edit** to retake the questionnaire.\n\nThe next time you update your app, you’ll see all of the app’s assigned ratings on this page. You can also click **Edit** if you want to retake the questionnaire. Be sure to retake the questionnaire if the content of your app has changed in a way that requires you to adjust any of your answers. IARC may also update the questions from time to time. If this happens, you may be prompted to retake the questionnaire when you submit an update.\n\n> **Note**  South Korean law requires games made available in South Korea to be rated through the South Korea [Game Rating Board](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=228256). If your app is a game, and if you want to offer it in South Korea, you must fill out this additional section and upload your rating certificate. Note that if your app is not a game, or if you don't want to offer it in South Korea, you can leave this section blank.\n\n## Appealing ratings or refused classifications\n\nIf you have questions about the age ratings your app received, or wish to appeal them, you can contact IARC via the link that appears in the rating certificate email that you will receive after your app has been published.\n\nIn some cases, the rating for your app may cause it to be classified as inappropriate for a particular country or region. If this occurs, you will see a message indicating the market(s) to which your app can’t be offered. If you disagree with this classification, you can request an appeal using the link that appears in the rating certificate email that you will receive from IARC.\n\n## Previous Windows Store age ratings\n\n\nPreviously, developers specified the age rating for their app rather than answer the questionnaire.
