You can specify one or more of the conditions specified by [**SystemConditionType**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224835) when registering your background task.

For example, if your background task runs on a timer and requires Internet connectivity, add the **InternetAvailable** condition to the [**TaskBuilder**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224768) before registering the task.

In the constructor, specify the condition that must be met by providing a [**SystemConditionType**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224835) enumeration value.\n\nThe following code creates a [**SystemCondition**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224834) object specifying Internet availability as the conditional requirement:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n> SystemCondition internetCondition = new SystemCondition(SystemConditionType.InternetAvailable);\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n> SystemCondition ^ internetCondition = ref new SystemCondition(SystemConditionType::InternetAvailable);\n> ```\n\n## Add the SystemCondition object to your background task\n\n\nTo add the condition, call the [**AddCondition**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224769) method on the [**BackgroundTaskBuilder**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224768) object, and pass it the [**SystemCondition**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224834) object.\n\nThe following code registers the InternetAvailable background task condition with the TaskBuilder:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n> taskBuilder.AddCondition(internetCondition);\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n> taskBuilder->AddCondition(internetCondition);\n> ```\n\n## Register your background task\n\n\nNow you can register your background task with the [**Register**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224772) method, and the task will not start until the specified condition is met.\n\nThe following code registers the task and stores the resulting BackgroundTaskRegistration object:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n> BackgroundTaskRegistration task = taskBuilder.Register();\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n> BackgroundTaskRegistration ^ task = taskBuilder->Register();\n> ```\n\n> **Note**  Universal Windows apps must call [**RequestAccessAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700485) before registering any of the background trigger types.\n\nTo ensure that your Universal Windows app continues to run properly after you release an update, you must call [**RemoveAccess**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700471) and then call [**RequestAccessAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh700485) when your app launches after being updated.
