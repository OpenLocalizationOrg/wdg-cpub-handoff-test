Together, they enable a variety of intuitive user experiences for moving between apps, pages, and content.\n\nIn some cases, you might be able to fit all of your app's content and functionality onto a single page without requiring the user to do anything more than pan to navigate through that content. However, the majority of apps typically have multiple pages of content and functionality with which to explore, engage, and interact. When an app has more than one page, you need to provide the right navigation experience.\n\nTo be successful and make sense to users, multi-page navigation experiences in UWP apps include (described in detail later):\n\n-   **The right navigation structure**\n\n    Building a navigation structure that makes sense to the user is crucial to creating an intuitive navigation experience.\n\n-   **Compatible navigation elements** that support the chosen structure.\n\n    Navigation elements can help the user get to the content they want and can also let users know where they are within the app. However, they also take up space that could be used for content or commanding elements, so it's important to use the navigation elements that are right for your app's structure.\n\n-   **Appropriate responses to system-level navigation features (such as Back)**\n\n    To provide a consistent experience that feels intuitive, respond to system-level navigation features in predictable ways.\n\n## <span id=\"Build_the_right_navigation_structure\"></span><span id=\"build_the_right_navigation_structure\"></span><span id=\"BUILD_THE_RIGHT_NAVIGATION_STRUCTURE\"></span>Build the right navigation structure\n\n\nLet's look at an app as a collection of groups of pages, with each page containing a unique set of content or functionality. For example, a photo app might have a page for taking photos, a page for image editing, and another page for managing your image library. The way you arrange these pages into groups defines the app's navigation structure. There are two common ways to arrange a group of pages:\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">In a hierarchy</th>\n<th align=\"left\">As peers</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p><img src=\"images/nav/nav-pages-hiearchy.png\" alt=\"Pages arranged in a hierarchy\" /></p></td>\n<td align=\"left\"><p><img src=\"images/nav/nav-pages-peer.png\" alt=\"Pages arranged as peers\" /></p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>Pages are organized into a tree-like structure.

To answer that question we must consider the number of pages in the group, whether the pages should be traversed in a particular order, and the relationship between the pages. In general, flatter structures are easier to understand and faster to navigate, but sometimes it's appropriate to have a deep hierarchy.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\"><p>We recommend using a hierarchical relationship when</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You expect the user to traverse the pages in a specific order.
