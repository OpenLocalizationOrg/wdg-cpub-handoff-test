App apps that access APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.AllJoyn**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn894971) namespace must use this capability. |\n| Blocked Chat Messages | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Allows apps to read SMS and MMS messages that have been blocked by the Spam Filter app. |\n| Chat Message Access | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Allows apps to read and delete Text Messages. It also allows apps to store chat messages in the system data store. |\n| Code Generation | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Allows apps to generate code dynamically. |\n| Enterprise Authentication | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | This capability is subject to the Windows Store policy. It provides the capability to connect to enterprise intranet resources that require domain credentials. This capability is not typically needed for most apps. | \n| Internet (Client) | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides outbound access to the Internet and networks in public places like airports and coffee shops. For example, Intranet networks where the user has designated the network as public. Most apps that require Internet access should use the capability. |\n| Internet (Client &amp; Server) | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides inbound and outbound access to the Internet and the networks in public places like airports and coffee shops. This capability is a superset of **Internet (Client)**. **Internet (Client)** doesn't need to be enabled if this capability is also enabled. Inbound access to critical ports is always blocked. |\n| Location| ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides access to the current location. This is obtained from dedicated hardware like a GPS sensor in the PC, or derived from available network information. | \n| Microphone | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides access to the microphone's audio feed. This allows the app to record from connected microphones. | \n| Music Library | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides the capability to add, change, or delete files in the **Music Library** for the local PC and **HomeGroup** PCs. | \n| Objects 3D | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides programmatic access to the user's **3D Objects**, allowing the app to enumerate and access all files in the library without user interaction. This capability is typically used in 3D apps and games that need to access the entire **3D Objects** library. | \n| Phone Call | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Allows apps to access all of the phone lines on the device and perform the following functions: place a call on the phone and show the system dialer without prompting the user; access line-related metadata; access line-related triggers. Allows the user-selected spam filter app to set and check the block list and call origin information. | \n| Pictures Library | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides the capability to add, change, or delete files in the **Pictures Library** for the local PC and **HomeGroup** PCs. | \n| Private Networks (Client &amp; Server) | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides inbound and outbound access to Intranet networks that have an authenticated domain controller, or that the user has designated as either home or work networks. Inbound access to critical ports is always blocked. | \n| Proximity | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides the capability to connect to devices in close proximity to the PC via near-field communication (NFC). Near-field proximity may be used to send files or communicate with an app on the nearby device. | \n| Removable Storage | ![Available in Manifest Designer](images/ap-tools.png) | Provides the capability to add, change, or delete files on removable storage devices. The app can only access the file types on removable storage that are defined in the manifest using the **File Type Associations** declaration.
