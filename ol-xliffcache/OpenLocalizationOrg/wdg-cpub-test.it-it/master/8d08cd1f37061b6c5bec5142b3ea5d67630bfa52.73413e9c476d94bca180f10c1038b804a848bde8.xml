page help determine the behavior of your IAP when offered to customers.\n\n## Product type\n\n\nFirst, you'll need to indicate which type of IAP you are offering. This selection refers to how the customer can use your IAP.\n\n> **Note**  You won't be able to change the product type for this IAP after it's been published.\n\n-   **Consumable:** A product that can be purchased, used (consumed), and then purchased again. Consumable IAPs are often used for things like in-game currency (gold, coins, etc.) which can be purchased in set amounts and then used up by the customer.\n-   **Durable:** A product that’s bought and owned by the buyer for a specified period of time. Durable IAPs are often used to unlock additional functionality in an app. Durable IAPs are not consumed, but you can set the **Product lifetime** so that they expire after a set duration (with options from 1-365 days). The default **Product lifetime** for a durable IAP is **Forever**, which means the IAP never expires.\n\n## Content type\n\n\nRegardless of your IAP's product type, you'll also need to indicate the type of content you're offering. By default, this is set to **Electronic software download**. If another option from the list seems to describe your IAP better (for example, if you are offering a music download or an e-book), choose that instead. Otherwise, you can leave this set to **Electronic software download**, which is appropriate for most IAPs.\n\n-   Electronic software download\n-   Electronic books\n-   Electronic magazine single issue\n-   Electronic newspaper single issue\n-   Music download\n-   Music streaming\n-   Online data storage/services\n-   Video download\n-   Video streaming\n-   Software as a service\n\n## Keywords\n\n\nYou have the option to provide up to ten keywords of up to 30 characters each for each IAP you submit. Your app can then query for products that match these words. This feature lets you build screens in your app that can load IAPs without you having to directly specify the product ID in your app's code. You can then change the IAP's keywords anytime, without having to make code changes in your app or submit the app again.\n\n> **Note**  Keywords are not available for use in packages targeting Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n## Tag\n\n\nYou also have the option to enter up to 3000 characters into the **Tag** field. This is a way to provide extra context for your in-app product. Let’s say you have a game, and you’re selling a bag of gold coins as an IAP. Using the Tags field, the app can query for this bag of gold. You can adjust the value at any time (in this case, the number of coins in your bag) by updating the info in the IAP's **Tag** field, without having to make code changes in your app or submit the app again.\n\n> **Note**  The **Tag** field is not available for use in packages targeting Windows 8 and Windows 8.1.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
