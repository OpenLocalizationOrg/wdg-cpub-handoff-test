we explain how to use Visual Studio to start writing a new software driver. Software drivers are different from device function drivers, filter drivers, and file system drivers, which we cover in other topics. For more information about software drivers and how they differ from other types of drivers, see [What is a Driver?](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Ff554678) and [Choosing a Driver Model](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Ff554652).\n\nTo begin, first determine which driver model is appropriate for your software driver. The three options are the Kernel Mode Driver Framework (KMDF), the legacy NT driver model, and the Windows Driver Model (WDM).
