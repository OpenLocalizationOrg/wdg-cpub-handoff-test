They'll introduce you to some of the concepts you'll need to know as you get started writing apps, and they'll cover how you can publish your work on the Windows Store.\n\nIn this section, we'll start gradually, and examine how to use Microsoft Visual Studio and the C# programming language to create a trivial app, and in particular how the process might vary from the tools you currently use. (Not a C# fan? Don't worry, other programming languages and tools are available, and we'll touch on this in [Getting started: Choosing a programming language](getting-started-choosing-a-programming-language.md)).\n\nWindows 10 introduces a new platform for creating engaging apps on desktop, laptop, tablet, phone devices and more. As Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps provide many unique capabilities, a straight port of your iOS app will miss out on these features. We therefore encourage you to try out the new controls and abilities to see how they will make your life as a developer easier, and new apps possible.\n\nThe bottom line is this: don't just port your app, but **reimagine** your app, and take advantage of new features and new devices.
