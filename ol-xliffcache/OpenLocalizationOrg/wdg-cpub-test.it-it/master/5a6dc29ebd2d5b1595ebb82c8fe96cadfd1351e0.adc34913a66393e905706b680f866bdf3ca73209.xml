By using Group Policy and Intune, you can set up a policy setting once, and then copy that setting onto many computers. For example, you can set up multiple security settings in a GPO that's linked to a domain, and then apply all of those settings to every computer in the domain. |\n| [Use Enterprise Mode to improve compatibility](emie-to-improve-compatibility.md) | If you have specific web sites and apps that you know have compatibility problems with Microsoft Edge, you can use the Enterprise Mode site list so that the web sites will automatically open using Internet Explorer 11. Additionally, if you know that your intranet sites aren't going to work properly with Microsoft Edge, you can set all intranet sites to automatically open using IE11. <p>Using Enterprise Mode means that you can continue to use Microsoft Edge as your default browser, while also ensuring that your apps continue working on IE11. |\n| [Security enhancements for Microsoft Edge](security-enhancements-microsoft-edge.md) |Microsoft Edge is designed with significant security improvements over existing browsers, helping to defend people from increasingly sophisticated and prevalent web-based attacks against Windows. |\n\n## Interoperability goals and enterprise guidance\n\nOur primary goal is that your modern websites work in Microsoft Edge. To that end, we've made Microsoft Edge the default browser.\n\nHowever, if you're running web apps that continue to use:\n\n* ActiveX controls\n\n* x-ua-compatible headers\n\n* &lt;meta&gt; tags\n\n* Enterprise mode or compatibility view to address compatibility issues\n\n* legacy document modes\n\nYou'll need to keep running them using IE11. If you don't have IE11 installed anymore, you can download it from the Windows Store or from the [Internet Explorer 11 download page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=290956). Alternatively, you can also use Enterprise Mode with Microsoft Edge to transition only the sites that need these technologies to load in IE11.
