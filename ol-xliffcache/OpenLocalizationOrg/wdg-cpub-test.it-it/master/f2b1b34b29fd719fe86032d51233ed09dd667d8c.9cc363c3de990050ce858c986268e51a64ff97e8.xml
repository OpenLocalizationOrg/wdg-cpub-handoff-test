id=\"PREREQUISITES\"></span>Prerequisites\n\n-   Driver package that is test signed and ready to install. You must first create and build your driver and then create a driver package for installation. For more information, see [Building a Driver](building_a_driver.md) and [Creating a Driver Package](creating_a_driver_package.md).\n-   Test computers that are configured and provisioned for deployment.

You can also run a custom installation script from these pages. You can choose to deploy the driver automatically whenever you build the driver solution in each configuration. For more information about deployment, see [Deploying a Driver to a Test Computer](deploying_a_driver_to_a_test_computer.md) and [Deployment Properties for Driver Projects](deployment_properties_for_driver_projects.md).\n\n1.  Open the property pages for your driver package project. Right-click the driver project in Solution Explorer and select **Properties**.\n\n2.  In the property pages for the driver package, click **Configuration Properties**, click **Driver Settings**, and then click **Deployment**.\n\n3.  Click **Enable deployment** and then select the test computer to use.\n\n4.  Click **Custom Command Line**. In the box, type custom command scripts that you want to run upon installation.\n\n5.  In the **Additional Files** text box, add the command script and other installation files to be copied to the test computer.
