describes how to use the CameraCaptureUI class to capture photos or videos using the camera UI built into Windows.\ntitle: Capture photos and video with CameraCaptureUI\n---\n\n# Capture photos and video with CameraCaptureUI\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\nThis article describes how to use the CameraCaptureUI class to capture photos or videos using the camera UI built into Windows. This feature is easy to use and allows your app to get a user-captured photo or video with just a few lines of code.\n\nIf your scenario requires more robust, low-level control of the capture operation, you should use the [**MediaCapture**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241124) object and implement your own capture experience. For more information, see [Capture photos and video with MediaCapture](capture-photos-and-video-with-mediacapture.md).\n\n## Capture a photo with CameraCaptureUI\n\nTo use the camera capture UI, include the [**Windows.Media.Capture**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br226738) namespace in your project. To do file operations with the returned image file, include [**Windows.Storage**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227346).\n\n[!code-cs[UsingCaptureUI](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetUsingCaptureUI)]\n\nTo capture a photo, create a new [**CameraCaptureUI**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241030) object. Using the object's [**PhotoSettings**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241058) property you can specify properties for the returned photo such as the image format of the photo. By default, the camera capture UI allows the user to crop the photo before it is returned, although this can be disabled with the [**AllowCropping**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241042) property. This example sets the [**CroppedSizeInPixels**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241044) to request that the returned image be 200 x 200 in pixels.\n\n**Note**  Imaging cropping in the CameraCaptureUI is not supported for devices in the Mobile device family. The value of the [**AllowCropping**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241042) property is ignored when your app is running on these devices.\n\nCall [**CaptureFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241057) and specify [**CameraCaptureUIMode.Photo**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241040) to specify that a photo should be captured. The method returns a [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) instance containing the image if the capture is successful. If the user cancels the capture, the returned object is null.\n\n[!code-cs[CapturePhoto](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetCapturePhoto)]\n\nOnce you have the **StorageFile** containing the captured photo, you can create a [**SoftwareBitmap**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn887358) object that can be used with several different Universal Windows app features.\n\nFirst you should include the [**Windows.Graphics.Imaging**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br226400) namespace in your project.\n\n[!code-cs[UsingSoftwareBitmap](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetUsingSoftwareBitmap)]\n\nCall [**OpenAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227116) to get a stream from the image file. Call [**BitmapDecoder.CreateAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br226182) to get a bitmap decoder for the stream. Then call [**GetSoftwareBitmap**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn887332) to get a **SoftwareBitmap** representation of the image.\n\n[!code-cs[SoftwareBitmap](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetSoftwareBitmap)]\n\nTo display the image in your UI, declare an [**Image**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242752) control in your XAML page.\n\n[!code-xml[ImageControl](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml#SnippetImageControl)]\n\nTo use the software bitmap in your XAML page, include the using [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243258) namespace in your project.\n\n[!code-cs[UsingSoftwareBitmapSource](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetUsingSoftwareBitmapSource)]\n\nThe **Image** control requires that the image source be in BGRA8 format with premultiplied alpha or no alpha, so call the static method [**SoftwareBitmap.Convert**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn887362) to create a new software bitmap with the desired format. Next, create a new [**SoftwareBitmapSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn997854) object and call [**SetBitmapAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn997856) to assign the software bitmap to the source. Finally, set the **Image** control's [**Source**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242760) property to display the captured photo in the UI.\n\n[!code-cs[SetImageSource](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetSetImageSource)]\n\n## Capture a video with CameraCaptureUI\n\nTo capture a video, create a new [**CameraCaptureUI**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241030) object. Using the object's [**VideoSettings**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241059) property you can specify properties for the returned video such as the format of the video.\n\nCall [**CaptureFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241057) and specify [**Video**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241059) to specify that a video should be capture. The method returns a [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) instance containing the video if the capture is successful. If the user cancels the capture, the returned object is null.\n\n[!code-cs[CaptureVideo](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetCaptureVideo)]\n\nWhat you do with the captured video file depends on the scenario for your app. The rest of this article shows you how to quickly create a media composition from one or more captured videos and show it in your UI.\n\nFirst, add a [**MediaElement**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242926) control in which the video composition will be displayed to your XAML page.\n\n[!code-xml[MediaElement](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml#SnippetMediaElement)]\n\nAdd the [**Windows.Media.Editing**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn640565) and [**Windows.Media.Core**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn278962) namespaces to your project.\n\n\n[!code-cs[UsingMediaComposition](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetUsingMediaComposition)]\n\nDeclare member variables for a [**MediaComposition**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn652646) object and a [**MediaStreamSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn282716) that you want to stay in scope for the lifetime of the page.\n\n[!code-cs[DeclareMediaComposition](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetDeclareMediaComposition)]\n\nOnce, before you capture any videos, you should create a new instance of the **MediaComposition** class.\n\n[!code-cs[InitComposition](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetInitComposition)]\n\nWith the video file returned from the camera capture UI, create a new [**MediaClip**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn652596) by calling [**MediaClip.CreateFromFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn652607). Add the media clip to the composition's [**Clips**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn652648) collection.\n\nCall [**GeneratePreviewMediaStreamSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn652674) to create the **MediaStreamSource** object from the composition.\n\n[!code-cs[AddToComposition](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetAddToComposition)]\n\nFinally, set the stream source to using the media element's [**SetMediaStreamSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn299029) method to show the composition in the UI.\n\n[!code-cs[SetMediaElementSource](./code/CameraCaptureUIWin10/cs/MainPage.xaml.cs#SnippetSetMediaElementSource)]\n\nYou can continue to capture video clips and add them to the composition.
