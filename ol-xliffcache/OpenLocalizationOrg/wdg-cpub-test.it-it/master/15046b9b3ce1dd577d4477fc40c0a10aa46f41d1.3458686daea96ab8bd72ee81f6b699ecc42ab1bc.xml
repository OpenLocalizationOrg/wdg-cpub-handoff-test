Windows supports printing through the ESC/POS printer control language, which provides efficient and functional commands for communicating with your printer.\n\nESC/POS is a command system created by Epson used across a wide range of POS printer systems, aimed at avoiding incompatible command sets by providing universal applicability. Most modern printers support ESC/POS.\n\nAll commands start with the ESC character (ASCII 27, HEX 1B) or GS (ASCII 29, HEX 1D), followed by another character that specifies the command. Normal text is simply sent to the printer, separated by line breaks.\n\nThe [**Windows PointOfService API**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn298071) provides much of that functionality for you via the **Print()** or **PrintLine()** methods. However, to get certain formatting or to send specific commands, you must use ESC/POS commands, built as a string and sent to the printer.\n\n## Example using bold and double size characters\n\nThe example below shows how to use ESC/POS commands to print in bold and double sized characters. Note that each command is built as a string, then inserted into the printJob calls.\n\n```csharp\n// … prior plumbing code removed for brevity\n// this code assumed you’ve already created a receipt print job (printJob)\n// and also that you’ve already checked the PosPrinter Capabilities to \n// verify that the printer supports Bold and DoubleHighDoubleWide print modes\n\nconst string ESC = “\\u001B”;\nconst string GS = “\\u001D”;\nconst string InitializePrinter = ESC + “@”;\nconst string BoldOn = ESC + “E” + “\\u0001”;\nconst string BoldOff = ESC + “E” + “\\0”;\nconst string DoubleOn = GS + “!” + “\\u0011”;  // 2x sized text (double-high + double-wide)\nconst string DoubleOff = GS + “!” + “\\0”;\n\nprintJob.Print(InitializePrinter);\nprintJob.PrintLine(“Here is some normal text.”);\nprintJob.PrintLine(BoldOn + “Here is some bold text.” + BoldOff);\nprintJob.PrintLine(DoubleOn + “Here is some large text.” + DoubleOff);\n\nprintJob.ExecuteAsync();\n```\n\nFor more information on ESC/POS, including available commands, check out the [Epson ESC/POS FAQ](http://content.epson.de/fileadmin/content/files/RSD/downloads/escpos.pdf).
