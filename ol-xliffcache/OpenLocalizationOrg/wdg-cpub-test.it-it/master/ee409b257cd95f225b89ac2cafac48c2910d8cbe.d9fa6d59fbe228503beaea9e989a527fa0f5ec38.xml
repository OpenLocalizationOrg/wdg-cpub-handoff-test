For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\nAdaptive tile templates are a new feature in Windows 10, allowing you to design your own tile notification content using a simple and flexible markup language that adapts to different screen densities. This article tells you how to create adaptive live tiles for your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. For the complete list of adaptive elements and attributes, see the [Adaptive tiles schema](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md).\n\n(If you'd like, you can still use the preset templates from the [Windows 8 tile template catalog](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh761491) when designing notifications for Windows 10.)\n\n## <span id=\"Getting_started\"></span><span id=\"getting_started\"></span><span id=\"GETTING_STARTED\"></span>Getting started\n\n\n**Install NotificationsExtensions.** If you'd like to use C# instead of XML to generate notifications, install the NuGet package named [NotificationsExtensions](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/NotificationsExtensions/wiki). The C# samples provided in this article use NotificationsExtensions.\n\n**Install Notifications Visualizer.** This free UWP app helps you design adaptive live tiles by providing an instant visual preview of your tile as you edit it, similar to Visual Studio's XAML editor/design view. You can read [this blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tiles_and_toasts/archive/2015/09/22/introducing-notifications-visualizer-for-windows-10.aspx) for more information, and you can download Notifications Visualizer [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/notifications-visualizer/9nblggh5xsl1).\n\n## <span id=\"Usage_guidance\"></span><span id=\"usage_guidance\"></span><span id=\"USAGE_GUIDANCE\"></span>Usage guidance\n\n\nAdaptive templates are designed to work across different form factors and notification types. Elements such as group and subgroup link together content and don't imply a particular visual behavior on their own. The final appearance of a notification should be based on the specific device on which it will appear, whether it's phone, tablet, or desktop, or another device.\n\nHints are optional attributes that can be added to elements in order to achieve a specific visual behavior. Hints can be device-specific or notification-specific.\n\n## <span id=\"A_basic_example\"></span><span id=\"a_basic_example\"></span><span id=\"A_BASIC_EXAMPLE\"></span>A basic example\n\n\nThis example demonstrates what the adaptive tile templates can produce.\n\n```XML\n<tile>\n  <visual>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileMedium\">\n      ...\n    </binding>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileWide\">\n      <text hint-style=\"subtitle\">Jennifer Parker</text>\n      <text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Photos from our trip</text>\n      <text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Check out these awesome photos I took while in New Zealand!</text>\n    </binding>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileLarge\">\n      ...\n    </binding>\n  \n  </visual>\n</tile>\n```\n\n```CSharp\nTileContent content = new TileContent()\n{\n    Visual = new TileVisual()\n    {\n        TileMedium = ...\n  \n        TileWide = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    new TileText()\n                    {\n                        Text = \"Jennifer Parker\",\n                        Style = TileTextStyle.Subtitle\n                    },\n  \n                    new TileText()\n                    {\n                        Text = \"Photos from our trip\",\n                        Style = TileTextStyle.CaptionSubtle\n                    },\n  \n                    new TileText()\n                    {\n                        Text = \"Check out these awesome photos I took while in New Zealand!\",\n                        Style = TileTextStyle.CaptionSubtle\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n  \n        TileLarge = ...\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![quick sample tile](images/adaptive-tiles-quicksample.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Tile_sizes\"></span><span id=\"tile_sizes\"></span><span id=\"TILE_SIZES\"></span>Tile sizes\n\n\nContent for each tile size is individually specified in separate [&lt;binding&gt;](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md) elements within the XML payload. Choose the target size by setting the template attribute to one of the following values:\n\n-   TileSmall\n-   TileMedium\n-   TileWide\n-   TileLarge (only for desktop)\n\nFor a single tile notification XML payload, provide &lt;binding&gt; elements for each tile size that you'd like to support, as shown in this example:\n\n```XML\n<tile>\n  <visual>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileSmall\">\n      <text>Small</text>\n    </binding>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileMedium\">\n      <text>Medium</text>\n    </binding>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileWide\">\n      <text>Wide</text>\n    </binding>\n  \n    <binding template=\"TileLarge\">\n      <text>Large</text>\n    </binding>\n  \n  </visual>\n</tile>\n```\n\n```CSharp\nTileContent content = new TileContent()\n{\n    Visual = new TileVisual()\n    {\n        TileSmall = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    new TileText() { Text = \"Small\" }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n  \n        TileMedium = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    new TileText() { Text = \"Medium\" }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n  \n        TileWide = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    new TileText() { Text = \"Wide\" }\n                }\n            }\n        },\n  \n        TileLarge = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    new TileText() { Text = \"Large\" }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tile sizes: small, medium, wide, and large](images/adaptive-tiles-sizes.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Branding\"></span><span id=\"branding\"></span><span id=\"BRANDING\"></span>Branding\n\n\nYou can control the branding on the bottom of a live tile (the display name and corner logo) by using the branding attribute on the notification payload. You can choose to display \"none,\" only the \"name,\" only the \"logo,\" or both with \"nameAndLogo.\"\n\n**Note**  Windows Phone doesn't support the corner logo, so \"logo\" and \"nameAndLogo\" default to \"name\" on phone.\n\n \n\n```XML\n<visual branding=\"logo\">\n  ...\n</visual>\n```\n\n```CSharp\nnew TileVisual()\n{\n    Branding = TileBranding.Logo,\n    ...\n}\n\nnew TileVisual()\n{\n    Branding = TileBranding.Logo,\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tiles, name and logo](images/adaptive-tiles-namelogo.png)\n\nBranding can be applied for specific tile sizes one of two ways:\n\n1. By applying the attribute on the [&lt;binding&gt;](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md) element\n2. By applying the attribute on the [&lt;visual&gt;](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md) element, which affects the entire notification payload\nIf you don't specify branding for a binding, it will use the branding that's provided on the visual element.\n\n```XML\n<tile>\n  <visual branding=\"nameAndLogo\">\n \n    <binding template=\"TileMedium\" branding=\"logo\">\n      ...\n    </binding>\n \n    <!--Inherits branding from visual-->\n    <binding template=\"TileWide\">\n      ...\n    </binding>\n \n  </visual>\n</tile>\n```\n\n```CSharp\nTileContent content = new TileContent()\n{\n    Visual = new TileVisual()\n    {\n        Branding = TileBranding.NameAndLogo,\n \n        TileMedium = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            Branding = TileBranding.Logo,\n            ...\n        },\n \n        // Inherits branding from Visual\n        TileWide = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**Default branding result:**\n\n![default branding on tiles](images/adaptive-tiles-defaultbranding.png)\n\nIf you don't specify the branding in your notification payload, the base tile's properties will determine the branding. If the base tile shows the display name, then the branding will default to \"name.\" Otherwise, the branding will default to \"none\" if the display name isn't shown.\n\n**Note**   This is a change from Windows 8.x, in which the default branding was \"logo.\"\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"Display_name\"></span><span id=\"display_name\"></span><span id=\"DISPLAY_NAME\"></span>Display name\n\n\nYou can override the display name of a notification by entering the text string of your choice with the **displayName** attribute. As with branding, you can specify this on the [&lt;visual&gt;](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md) element, which affects the entire notification payload, or on the [&lt;binding&gt;](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md) element, which only affects individual tiles.\n\n```XML\n<tile>\n  <visual branding=\"nameAndLogo\" displayName=\"Wednesday 22\">\n \n    <binding template=\"TileMedium\" displayName=\"Wed. 22\">\n      ...\n    </binding>\n \n    <!--Inherits displayName from visual-->\n    <binding template=\"TileWide\">\n      ...\n    </binding>\n \n  </visual>\n</tile>\n```\n\n```CSharp\nTileContent content = new TileContent()\n{\n    Visual = new TileVisual()\n    {\n        Branding = TileBranding.NameAndLogo,\n        DisplayName = \"Wednesday 22\",\n \n        TileMedium = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            DisplayName = \"Wed. 22\",\n            ...\n        },\n \n        // Inherits DisplayName from Visual\n        TileWide = new TileBinding()\n        {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tiles display name](images/adaptive-tiles-displayname.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Text\"></span><span id=\"text\"></span><span id=\"TEXT\"></span>Text\n\n\nThe [&lt;text&gt;](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md) element is used to display text. You can use hints to modify how text appears.\n\n```XML\n<text>This is a line of text</text></code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\n<span codelanguage=\"CSharp\"></span>\n```CSharp\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">C#</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\nnew TileText()\n{\n    Text = \"This is a line of text\"\n};\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tile text](images/adaptive-tiles-text.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Text_wrapping\"></span><span id=\"text_wrapping\"></span><span id=\"TEXT_WRAPPING\"></span>Text wrapping\n\n\nBy default, text doesn't wrap and will continue off the edge of the tile. Use the **hint-wrap** attribute to set text wrapping on a text element. You can also control the minimum and maximum number of lines by using **hint-minLines** and **hint-maxLines**, both of which accept positive integers.\n\n```XML\n<text hint-wrap=\"true\">This is a line of wrapping text</text></code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\n<span codelanguage=\"CSharp\"></span>\n```CSharp\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">C#</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\nnew TileText()\n{\n    Text = \"This is a line of wrapping text\",\n    Wrap = true\n};\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tile with text wrapping](images/adaptive-tiles-textwrapping.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Text_styles\"></span><span id=\"text_styles\"></span><span id=\"TEXT_STYLES\"></span>Text styles\n\n\nStyles control the font size, color, and weight of text elements. There are a number of available styles, including a \"subtle\" variation of each style that sets the opacity to 60%, which usually makes the text color a shade of light gray.\n\n```XML\n<text hint-style=\"base\">Header content</text>\n<text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Subheader content</text>\n```\n\n```CSharp\nnew TileText()\n{\n    Text = \"Header content\",\n    Style = TileTextStyle.Base\n},\n \nnew TileText()\n{\n    Text = \"Subheader content\",\n    Style = TileTextStyle.CaptionSubtle\n}\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tiles text styles](images/adaptive-tiles-textstyles.png)\n\n**Note**  The style defaults to caption if hint-style isn't specified.\n\n \n\n**Basic text styles**\n\n|                                |                           |             |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| &lt;text hint-style=\"\\*\" /&gt; | Font height               | Font weight |\n| caption                        | 12 effective pixels (epx) | Regular     |\n| body                           | 15 epx                    | Regular     |\n| base                           | 15 epx                    | Semibold    |\n| subtitle                       | 20 epx                    | Regular     |\n| title                          | 24 epx                    | Semilight   |\n| subheader                      | 34 epx                    | Light       |\n| header                         | 46 epx                    | Light       |\n\n \n\n**Numeral text style variations**\n\nThese variations reduce the line height so that content above and below come much closer to the text.\n\n|                  |\n|------------------|\n| titleNumeral     |\n| subheaderNumeral |\n| headerNumeral    |\n\n \n\n**Subtle text style variations**\n\nEach style has a subtle variation that gives the text a 60% opacity, which usually makes the text color a shade of light gray.\n\n|                        |\n|------------------------|\n| captionSubtle          |\n| bodySubtle             |\n| baseSubtle             |\n| subtitleSubtle         |\n| titleSubtle            |\n| titleNumeralSubtle     |\n| subheaderSubtle        |\n| subheaderNumeralSubtle |\n| headerSubtle           |\n| headerNumeralSubtle    |\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"Text_alignment\"></span><span id=\"text_alignment\"></span><span id=\"TEXT_ALIGNMENT\"></span>Text alignment\n\n\nText can be horizontally aligned left, center, or right.

For example, you might have two text elements, a header, and a subheader, and it would not make sense for only the header to be shown. By grouping those elements inside a subgroup, the elements will either all be displayed (if they can fit) or not be displayed at all (because they can't fit).\n\nTo provide the best experience across devices and screens, provide multiple groups. Having multiple groups allows your tile to adapt to larger screens.\n\n**Note**  The only valid child of a group is a subgroup.\n\n \n\n```XML\n...\n<binding template=\"TileWide\" branding=\"nameAndLogo\">\n  <group>\n    <subgroup>\n      <text hint-style=\"subtitle\">Jennifer Parker</text>\n      <text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Photos from our trip</text>\n      <text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Check out these awesome photos I took while in New Zealand!</text>\n    </subgroup>\n  </group>\n \n  <text />\n \n  <group>\n    <subgroup>\n      <text hint-style=\"subtitle\">Steve Bosniak</text>\n      <text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Build 2015 Dinner</text>\n      <text hint-style=\"captionSubtle\">Want to go out for dinner after Build tonight?</text>\n    </subgroup>\n  </group>\n</binding>\n...\n```\n\n```CSharp\n...\n \nTileWide = new TileBinding()\n{\n    Branding = TileBranding.NameAndLogo,\n    Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n    {\n        Children =\n        {\n            CreateGroup(\n                from: \"Jennifer Parker\",\n                subject: \"Photos from our trip\",\n                body: \"Check out these awesome photos I took while in New Zealand!\"),\n \n            // For spacing\n            new TileText(),\n \n            CreateGroup(\n                from: \"Steve Bosniak\",\n                subject: \"Build 2015 Dinner\",\n                body: \"Want to go out for dinner after Build tonight?\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n \n...\n \n \nprivate static TileGroup CreateGroup(string from, string subject, string body)\n{\n    return new TileGroup()\n    {\n        Children =\n        {\n            new TileSubgroup()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    new TileText()\n                    {\n                        Text = from,\n                        Style = TileTextStyle.Subtitle\n                    },\n \n                    new TileText()\n                    {\n                        Text = subject,\n                        Style = TileTextStyle.CaptionSubtle\n                    },\n \n                    new TileText()\n                    {\n                        Text = body,\n                        Style = TileTextStyle.CaptionSubtle\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![adaptive tiles groups and subgroups](images/adaptive-tiles-groups-subgroups.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Subgroups__columns_\"></span><span id=\"subgroups__columns_\"></span><span id=\"SUBGROUPS__COLUMNS_\"></span>Subgroups (columns)\n\n\nSubgroups also allow you to divide data into semantic sections within a group. For live tiles, this visually translates to columns.\n\nThe **hint-weight** attribute lets you to control the widths of columns. The value of **hint-weight** is expressed as a weighted proportion of available space, which is identical to **GridUnitType.Star** behavior. For equal-width columns, assign each weight to 1.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">hint-weight</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Percentage of width</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">Total weight: 4</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n![subgroups, even columns](images/adaptive-tiles-subgroups01.png)\n\nTo make one column twice as large as another column, assign the smaller column a weight of 1 and the larger column a weight of 2.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">hint-weight</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Percentage of width</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">1</td>\n<td align=\"left\">33.3%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">2</td>\n<td align=\"left\">66.7%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">Total weight: 3</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n![subgroups, one column twice the size of the other](images/adaptive-tiles-subgroups02.png)\n\nIf you want your first column to take up 20% of the total width and your second column to take up 80% of the total width, assign the first weight to 20 and the second weight to 80. If your total weights equal 100, they'll act as percentages.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n<col width=\"50%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">hint-weight</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Percentage of width</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">20</td>\n<td align=\"left\">20%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">80</td>\n<td align=\"left\">80%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">Total weight: 100</td>\n<td align=\"left\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\n![subgroups, with weights totalling 100](images/adaptive-tiles-subgroups03.png)\n\n**Note**  An 8-pixel margin is automatically added between the columns.\n\n \n\nWhen you have more than two subgroups, you should specify the **hint-weight**, which only accepts positive integers. If you don't specify hint-weight for the first subgroup, it will be assigned a weight of 50. The next subgroup that doesn't have a specified hint-weight will be assigned a weight equal to 100 minus the sum of the preceding weights, or to 1 if the result is zero. The remaining subgroups that don't have specified hint-weights will be assigned a weight of 1.\n\nHere's sample code for a weather tile that shows how you can achieve a tile with five columns of equal width:\n\n```XML\n...\n<binding template=\"TileWide\" displayName=\"Seattle\" branding=\"name\">\n  <group>\n    <subgroup hint-weight=\"1\">\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">Mon</text>\n      <image src=\"Assets\\Weather\\Mostly Cloudy.png\" hint-removeMargin=\"true\"/>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">63°</text>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\" hint-style=\"captionsubtle\">42°</text>\n    </subgroup>\n    <subgroup hint-weight=\"1\">\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">Tue</text>\n      <image src=\"Assets\\Weather\\Cloudy.png\" hint-removeMargin=\"true\"/>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">57°</text>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\" hint-style=\"captionsubtle\">38°</text>\n    </subgroup>\n    <subgroup hint-weight=\"1\">\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">Wed</text>\n      <image src=\"Assets\\Weather\\Sunny.png\" hint-removeMargin=\"true\"/>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">59°</text>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\" hint-style=\"captionsubtle\">43°</text>\n    </subgroup>\n    <subgroup hint-weight=\"1\">\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">Thu</text>\n      <image src=\"Assets\\Weather\\Sunny.png\" hint-removeMargin=\"true\"/>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">62°</text>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\" hint-style=\"captionsubtle\">42°</text>\n    </subgroup>\n    <subgroup hint-weight=\"1\">\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">Fri</text>\n      <image src=\"Assets\\Weather\\Sunny.png\" hint-removeMargin=\"true\"/>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\">71°</text>\n      <text hint-align=\"center\" hint-style=\"captionsubtle\">66°</text>\n    </subgroup>\n  </group>\n</binding>\n...\n```\n\n```CSharp\n...\nTileWide = new TileBinding()\n{\n    DisplayName = \"Seattle\",\n    Branding = TileBranding.Name,\n    Content = new TileBindingContentAdaptive()\n    {\n        Children =\n        {\n            new TileGroup()\n            {\n                Children =\n                {\n                    CreateSubgroup(\"Mon\", \"Mostly Cloudy.png\", \"63°\", \"42°\"),\n \n                    CreateSubgroup(\"Tue\", \"Cloudy.png\", \"57°\", \"38°\"),\n \n                    CreateSubgroup(\"Wed\", \"Sunny.png\", \"59°\", \"43°\"),\n \n                    CreateSubgroup(\"Thu\", \"Sunny.png\", \"62°\", \"42°\"),\n \n                    CreateSubgroup(\"Fri\", \"Sunny.png\", \"71°\", \"66°\")\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n...\n \n \nprivate static TileSubgroup CreateSubgroup(string day, string image, string highTemp, string lowTemp)\n{\n    return new TileSubgroup()\n    {\n        Weight = 1,\n \n        Children =\n        {\n            new TileText()\n            {\n                Text = day,\n                Align = TileTextAlign.Center\n            },\n \n            new TileImage()\n            {\n                Source = new TileImageSource(\"Assets/Weather/\" + image),\n                RemoveMargin = true\n            },\n \n            new TileText()\n            {\n                Text = highTemp,\n                Align = TileTextAlign.Center\n            },\n \n            new TileText()\n            {\n                Text = lowTemp,\n                Align = TileTextAlign.Center,\n                Style = TileTextStyle.CaptionSubtle\n            }\n        }\n    };\n}\n```\n\n**Result:**\n\n![example of a weather tile](images/adaptive-tiles-weathertile.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Images\"></span><span id=\"images\"></span><span id=\"IMAGES\"></span>Images\n\n\nThe &lt;image&gt; element is used to display images on the tile notification.
