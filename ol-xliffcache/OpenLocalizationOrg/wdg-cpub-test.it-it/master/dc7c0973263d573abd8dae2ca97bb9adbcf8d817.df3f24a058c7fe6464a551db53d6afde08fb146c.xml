Your app can help in these situations by requiring the user to confirm an action, or by providing a way of undoing recent actions.\n\n-   For actions that can't be undone and have major consequences, we recommend using a confirmation dialog. Examples of such actions include:\n    -   Overwriting a file\n    -   Not saving a file before closing\n    -   Confirming permanent deletion of a file or data\n    -   Making a purchase (unless the user opts out of requiring a confirmation)\n    -   Submitting a form, such as signing up for something\n-   For actions that can be undone, offering a simple undo command is usually enough. Examples of such actions include:\n    -   Deleting a file\n    -   Deleting an email (not permanently)\n    -   Modifying content or editing text\n    -   Renaming a file\n\n**Tip**  Be careful of how much your app uses confirmation dialogs; they can be very helpful when the user makes a mistake, but they are a hindrance whenever the user is trying to perform an action intentionally.\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"_________Optimize_for_specific_input_types_______\"></span><span id=\"_________optimize_for_specific_input_types_______\"></span><span id=\"_________OPTIMIZE_FOR_SPECIFIC_INPUT_TYPES_______\"></span> Optimize for specific input types\n\n\nSee the [Interaction primer](../input-and-devices/input-primer.md) for more detail on optimizing user experiences around a specific input type or device.\n\n\n\\[This article contains information that is specific to UWP apps and Windows 10.
