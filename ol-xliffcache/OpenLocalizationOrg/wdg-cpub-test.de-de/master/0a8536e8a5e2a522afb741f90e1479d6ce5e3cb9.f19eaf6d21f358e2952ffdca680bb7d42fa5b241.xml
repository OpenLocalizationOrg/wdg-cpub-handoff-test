2008 R2 with Service Pack 1 (SP1)\n\nIt’s important that you test the sites you’re adding, or considering removing, from your Enterprise Mode site list. To make this testing easier, you can turn off the site list or the entire Enterprise Mode functionality. For example, you might have an intranet site on your list that you’ve upgraded to be compatible with the new web standards . If you test the site while the site list is active, Internet Explorer 11 will automatically switch to Enterprise Mode. By turning off the site list, you can see what the page actually looks like and decide whether to remove it from your site list.\n\nIn addition, if you no longer want your users to be able to turn Enterprise Mode on locally, you can remove Enterprise Mode from the local **Tools** menu.\n\n**Important**<br>\nTurning off both of these features turns off Enterprise Mode for your company. Turning off Enterprise Mode also causes any websites included in your employee’s manual site lists to not appear in Enterprise Mode.\n\n  ![](images/wedge.gif) **To turn off the site list using Group Policy**\n\n1.  Open your Group Policy editor, like Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).\n\n2.  Go to the **Use the Enterprise Mode IE website list** setting, and then click **Disabled**.<p>\nEnterprise Mode will no longer look for the site list, effectively turning off Enterprise Mode. However, if you previously turned on local control for your employees, Enterprise Mode will still be available from the **Tools** menu. You need to turn that part of the functionality off separately.\n\n ![](images/wedge.gif) **To turn off local control using Group Policy**\n\n1.
