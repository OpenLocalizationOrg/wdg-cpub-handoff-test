As we've shown here, it doesn't require a lot of effort to add an additional attribute to your existing **ListenFor** elements and support suffix variants. It feels a lot more natural to say \"Hey Cortana, show my next trip to Las Vegas on Adventure works\" than \"Hey Cortana, Adventure Works, show my next trip to Las Vegas\".\n\nConsider using your app name as a prefix in cases where the voice command conflicts with existing **Cortana** functionality (calling, messaging, and so on). For example, \"Adventure Works, message \\[travel agent\\] about Las Vegas trip\".\n\n## <span id=\"Complete_example\"></span><span id=\"complete_example\"></span><span id=\"COMPLETE_EXAMPLE\"></span>Complete example\n\n\nHere is a VCD file that demonstrates various ways to provide more natural language voice commands.\n\n**Note**  It is valid to have multiple **ListenFor** elements, each with a different **RequireAppName** attribute value.\n\n \n\n```XML\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<VoiceCommands xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/voicecommands/1.1\">\n  <CommandSet xml:lang=\"en-us\" Name=\"commandSet_en-us\">\n    <AppName>Adventure Works</AppName>\n    <Example> When is my trip to Las Vegas? </Example>\n    <Command Name=\"whenIsTripToDestination\">\n      <Example> When is my trip to Las Vegas?</Example>\n      <ListenFor RequireAppName=\"BeforePhrase\">\n        when is my] trip to {destination} </ListenFor>\n\n      <!-- This ListenFor command will set up Cortana to accept commands like \n           “Show my next trip to Las Vegas on Adventure Works”; “Show my next \n           trip to Las Vegas using Adventure Works” -->\n      <ListenFor RequireAppName=\"AfterPhrase\">\n        show [my] next trip to {destination} </ListenFor>\n\n      <!-- This ListenFor command will set up Cortana to accept commands when \n           the user specifies your app name either before or after the command. \n           “Adventure Works, show my next trip to Las Vegas”; \n           “Show my next trip to Last Vegas on Adventure works” -->\n      <ListenFor RequireAppName=\"BeforeOrAfterPhrase\">\n        show [my] next trip to {destination} </ListenFor>\n\n      <!-- This ListenFor command will set up Cortana to accept commands \n           when the user specifies your app name inline. \n           “Show my next Adventure Works trip to Las Vegas” -->\n      <ListenFor RequireAppName=\"ExplicitlySpecified\">\n        show [my] next {builtin:AppName} trip to {destination} </ListenFor>\n\n      <Feedback> Looking for trip to {destination} </Feedback>\n      <Navigate />\n    </Command>\n    <PhraseList Label=\"destination\">\n      <Item> Las Vegas </Item>\n      <Item> Dallas </Item>\n      <Item> New York </Item>\n    </PhraseList>\n  </CommandSet>\n  <!-- Other CommandSets for other languages -->\n</VoiceCommands>\n```\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related articles\n\n\n**Developers**\n* [Cortana interactions](cortana-interactions.md)\n* [Define custom recognition constraints](define-custom-recognition-constraints.md)\n* [**VCD elements and attributes v1.2**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn706593)\n\n**Designers**\n* [Cortana design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974233)\n* [Speech design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn596121)\n\n**Samples**\n* [Cortana voice command sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=619899)\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
