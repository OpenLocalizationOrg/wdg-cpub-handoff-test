a cancelled background task\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10.

If an out of memory exception is not surfaced, or the app does not handle it, then the background task will be terminated without warning and without raising the OnCanceled event. This helps to ensure the user experience of the app in the foreground. Your background task should be designed to handle this scenario.\n\nThis topic assumes you have already created a background task class, including the Run method that is used as the background task entry point. To get started quickly building a background task, see [Create and register a background task](create-and-register-a-background-task.md). For more in-depth information on conditions and triggers, see [Support your app with background tasks](support-your-app-with-background-tasks.md).\n\n## Use the OnCanceled method to recognize cancellation requests\n\nWrite a method to handle the cancellation event.\n\nCreate a method named OnCanceled that has the following footprint. This method is the entry point called by the Windows Runtime whenever a cancellation request is made against your background task.\n\nThe OnCanceled method needs to have the following footprint:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n>    private void OnCanceled(IBackgroundTaskInstance sender, BackgroundTaskCancellationReason reason)\n>    {\n>        // TODO: Add code to notify the background task that it is cancelled.\n>    }\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n>    void ExampleBackgroundTask::OnCanceled(IBackgroundTaskInstance^ taskInstance, BackgroundTaskCancellationReason reason)\n>    {\n>        // TODO: Add code to notify the background task that it is cancelled.\n>    }\n> ```\n\nAdd a flag variable called **\\_CancelRequested** to the background task class. This variable will be used to indicate when a cancellation request has been made.\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n>   volatile bool _CancelRequested = false;\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n>   private:\n>     volatile bool CancelRequested;\n> ```\n\nIn the OnCanceled method you created in step 1, set the flag variable **\\_CancelRequested** to **true**.\n\nThe full [background task sample]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=227509) OnCanceled method sets **\\_CancelRequested** to **true** and writes potentially useful debug output:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n>     private void OnCanceled(IBackgroundTaskInstance sender, BackgroundTaskCancellationReason reason)\n>     {\n>         //\n>         // Indicate that the background task is canceled.\n>         //\n> \n>         _cancelRequested = true;\n> \n>         Debug.WriteLine(\"Background \" + sender.Task.Name + \" Cancel Requested...\");\n>     }\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n>     void SampleBackgroundTask::OnCanceled(IBackgroundTaskInstance^ taskInstance, BackgroundTaskCancellationReason reason)\n>     {\n>         //\n>         // Indicate that the background task is canceled.\n>         //\n> \n>         CancelRequested = true;\n>     }\n> ```\n\nIn the background task's Run method, register the OnCanceled event handler method before starting work. For example, use the following line of code:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n>     taskInstance.Canceled += new BackgroundTaskCanceledEventHandler(OnCanceled);\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n>     taskInstance->Canceled += ref new BackgroundTaskCanceledEventHandler(this, &SampleBackgroundTask::OnCanceled);\n> ```\n\n## Handle cancellation by exiting the Run method\n\n\nWhen a cancellation request is received, the Run method needs to stop work and exit by recognizing when **\\_cancelRequested** is set to **true**.\n\nModify the code of your background task class to check the flag variable while it's working. If **\\_cancelRequested** set to true, stop work from continuing.\n\nThe [background task sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=618666) includes a check that stops the periodic timer callback if the background task is canceled:\n\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n> ```cs\n>     if ((_cancelRequested == false) &amp;&amp; (_progress &lt; 100))\n>     {\n>         _progress += 10;\n>         _taskInstance.Progress = _progress;\n>     }\n>     else\n>     {\n>         _periodicTimer.Cancel();\n> \n>         // TODO: Record whether the task completed or was cancelled.\n>     }\n> ```\n> ```cpp\n>     if ((CancelRequested == false) &amp;&amp; (Progress &lt; 100))\n>     {\n>         Progress += 10;\n>         TaskInstance->Progress = Progress;\n>     }\n>     else\n>     {\n>         PeriodicTimer->Cancel();\n> \n>         // TODO: Record whether the task completed or was cancelled.\n>     }\n> ```\n\n> **Note**  The code sample shown above uses the [**IBackgroundTaskInstance**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224797).[**Progress**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224800) property being used to record background task progress.
