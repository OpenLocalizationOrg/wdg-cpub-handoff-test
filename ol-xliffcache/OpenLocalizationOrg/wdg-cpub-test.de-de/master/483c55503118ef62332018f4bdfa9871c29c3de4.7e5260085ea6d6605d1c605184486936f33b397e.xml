account.\ntitle: Manage account users\nms.assetid: 9245F0D0-7D8F-4741-AFB4-FBA5601D0A9B\n---\n\n# Manage account users\n\n\nYou can use Azure Active Directory to add users to your Dev Center account. Each user is assigned a role that gives them a specific set of permissions to the account. You can also assign a role to a group of users, or to an Azure AD application.\n\n**Important**  In order to add and manage account users, you must first associate your Dev Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory. This requires you to sign in to Azure AD with a Global Admin account. Once you establish this association, you won't be able to remove it without contacting support.\n\n \n\n## Associate your Dev Center account with your organization's Azure Active Directory\n\n\nWindows Dev Center leverages Azure Active Directory for multi-user management and roles assignment. If your organization already uses Office 365 or other business services from Microsoft, you already have Azure AD. Otherwise, you can [get it for free](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=703757).\n\nNote that only one Dev Center account can be associated with an Azure Active Directory. Similarly, only one Azure Active Directory can be associated with a Dev Center account.\n\nTo set up the association:\n\n1.  Go to your **Account settings** and click **Manage users**.\n2.  Click the button to associate your account with Azure AD.\n3.  Sign in to your Azure AD account. This account must have Global Admin permission in order to set up the association.\n4.  Review the organization and domain name for your Azure AD account. To complete the association, click **Confirm**.\n\nIf the association is successful, you will then be ready to add and manage account users on the **Manage users** page of your account.\n\n**Note**  You can only add users to your Dev Center account if they are part of your organization’s Azure Active Directory. You won’t be able to add users to your Dev Center account with their Microsoft accounts.\n\n \n\n## Add and manage account users, groups, and Azure AD applications\n\n\nOnce you have established the association, you can add users, groups, and Azure AD applications to your account. You can also change roles, edit account details, or remove users.\n\n**Note**  If your organization uses [directory integration](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=724033) to sync the on-premises directory service with your Azure AD, you won't be able to create new users, groups, or Azure AD applications in Dev Center. You (or another admin in your on-premises directory) will need to create them directly in the on-premises directory before you'll be able to see and add them in Dev Center.\n\n \n\nWhen managing users, keep the following in mind:\n\n-   All Dev Center users must have an active account in your organization's Azure AD.\n-   Creating a **new** user or group in Dev Center will also add them to your organization's Azure AD.\n-   Making changes to a user or group's name in Dev Center will make those changes in your organization's Azure AD.\n-   Users (including groups and Azure AD applications) will be able to access the entire Dev Center account with the permissions associated with their assigned role. You can't limit a user's access so that they can only work with specific apps and/or IAPs.\n-   You can allow a user, group, or Azure AD application to have access to more than one role's functionality by selecting multiple roles.\n-   A user with a certain role may also be part of a group that has a different role. In that case, the user will have access to the functionality associated with both roles.\n\n### Roles and permissions\n\nEach user, group, or Azure AD application that you add to an account must be assigned at least one of the following roles. Each role has a specific set of permissions in order to perform certain functions within the account.\n\n**Note**  The owner of the account is the person who first created it with a Microsoft account (rather than any users added through Azure AD). This account owner is the only person with complete access to the account, including the ability to delete apps, create and edit all account users, and change all financial and account settings. The Microsoft account that was used to create the account must be used when creating app packages in Microsoft Visual Studio.\n\n \n\n| Role                 | Description              |\n|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Manager              | Has complete access to the account, except for changing tax and payout settings. This includes managing users in Dev Center, but note that the ability to create and delete users is dependent on the account's permission in Azure AD. That is, if a user is assigned the Manager role, but does not have admin permissions in the organization's Azure AD, they will not be able to create new users or delete users from the directory (but they can change a user's Dev Center role). |\n| Developer            | Can upload packages and submit apps and IAPs, and can view the [Usage report](usage-report.md) for telemetry details.

However, when creating app packages in Visual Studio, the Microsoft account used to open the developer account must be used, rather than an Azure AD account.\n\n \n\n### Add and manage account users\n\nTo identify users that you want to add to your Dev Center account and assign them a role, click **Add users**.\n\nYou can add one or more users from your organization's directory to your Dev Center account. Note that when you add more than one user at the same time, you must assign the same role. If you want to add users but assign them different roles, repeat the steps below for each role.\n\n**Add users from your organization's directory**\n\n1.  From the **Manage users** page, click **Add users**.\n2.  Select one or more users from the list that appears. You can use the search box to search for specific users.\n3.  When you are finished selecting users, click **Add selected**.\n4.  In the **Roles** section, select one or more roles to assign to this set of users.\n5.  Click **Save**.\n\nIf you want to grant Dev Center access to a brand new user account, you can create one in the **Manage users** section. Note that this will create a new account in your organization's directory, not just in your Dev Center account.\n\n**Create a new user account**\n\n1.  From the **Manage users** page, click **Add users**.\n2.  On the next page, click **New user**.\n3.  Enter the first name, last name, and username for the new user.\n4.

Enter the **App ID URI** for the new Azure AD application. This is a logical identifier for the Azure AD application that is presented when it sends a single sign-on request to Azure AD. Note that the **App ID URI** must be unique for each Azure AD application in your directory, and it can't be longer than 256 characters.\n5.  In the **Roles** section, select one or more roles to assign to the new Azure AD application\n6.  Click **Save**.\n\nYou can make changes to Azure AD applications that you've added to your Dev Center account in the **Manage users** section. Note that changes to the Reply URL and App ID URI will be reflected in your organization's directory, not just in your Dev Center account. Role changes will only affect the Azure AD application's permissions within Dev Center.\n\n**Edit an Azure AD application**\n\n1.  From the **Manage users** page, click the name of the Azure AD application account that you want to edit.\n2.  To change the **Reply URL** or **App ID URI**, enter the new values here. Remember, these changes will be made in your organization's directory.\n3.  To change the Azure AD application's role, select or deselect the role(s) that you want to apply.\n4.  Click **Save**.\n\nIf your Azure AD application reads and writes data in Microsoft Azure AD, it will need a key. You can create keys for an Azure AD application by editing its info in Dev Center. You can also remove keys that are no longer needed.\n\n**Manage keys for an Azure AD application**\n\n1.  From the **Manage users** page, click the name of the Azure AD application.\n\n    **Tip**  When you click the name of the Azure AD application, you'll see all of the active keys for the Azure AD application, including the date on which the key was created and when it will expire. To remove a key that is no longer needed, click **Remove**.\n\n2.  To add a new key, click **Add new key**.\n\n3.  You will see a screen showing the **Client ID** and **Key** values.\n\n    **Important**  Be sure to print or copy this info, as you won't be able to access it again after you leave this page.\n\n4.  If you want to create more keys, click **Add another key**.\n\n### Removing users, groups, and Azure AD applications\n\nTo remove a user, group, or Azure AD application from your Dev Center account, click the **Remove** link that appears by their name on the **Manage users** page. After confirming that you want to remove it, that user, group, or Azure AD application will no longer be able to access to your Dev Center account (unless you add it again later).\n\n**Note**  Removing a user, group, or Azure AD application means that it will no longer have access to your Dev Center account. It does not delete the user, group, or Azure AD application from your organization's directory.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
