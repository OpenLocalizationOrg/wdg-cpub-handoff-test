For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\nSet your app's splash screen image and background color using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\n\n## Set the splash screen image and background color in Visual Studio 2015\n\n\nWhen you use a Visual Studio 2015 template to create your app, a default image is added to your project and set as the splash screen image. The background color for your splash screen defaults to a light gray. If you want to change the default image or color of your app's splash screen, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Open your existing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app project in Visual Studio 2015.\n2.  From **Solution Explorer**, open the \"Package.appxmanifest\" file. You can also open this file from the menu bar by choosing **Project** &gt; **Store** &gt; **Edit App Manifest**.\n3.  Open the **Visual Assets** tab and select **Splash Screen** from the **All Image Assets** pane on the left side of the \"Package.appxmanifest\" window. If you're changing your splash screen for the first time, you'll see the \"Assets\\\\SplashScreen.png\" path in the **Splash Screen** field.\n\n    The following screen shot shows the \"Package.appxmanifest\" window in Visual Studio 2015. Depending on the type of project, you will see a slightly different set of visual assets.\n\n    ![a screen shot of the \"package.appxmanifest\" window in visual studio 2013](images/appmanifest.png)\n\n    If you open \"Package.appxmanifest\" in a text editor, the [**SplashScreen element**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211467) appears as a child of the [**VisualElements element**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211471). The default splash screen markup in the manifest file looks like this in a text editor:\n\n    ```xaml\n    <uap:SplashScreen Image=\"Assets\\SplashScreen.png\" />\n    ```\n\n4.  To select a new splash screen image for a UWP app, press the button with an ellipsis that appears next to the **1240 x 600 px** label below **Scaled Assets**. Choose the 1240 x 600 pixel image (.png, .jpg, or .jpeg) you'd like to use for your splash screen image.\n\n    **Important**  The splash screen image you choose must be 620 x 300 pixels using a 1x scaling factor. Also, when designing your splash screen, note that it is smaller than the screen, and centered. It does not fill the screen like a splash screen for a Windows Phone Store app does.\n\n     \n\n5.  To select a new splash screen image for a Windows Phone Store app, press the button with an ellipsis that appears next to the **1152 x 1920 px** label below **Scaled Assets**. Choose the 1152 x 1920 pixel image (.png, .jpg, or .jpeg) you'd like to use for your splash screen image.\n\n    **Important**  The splash screen image you choose must be 1152 x 1920 pixels which is the correct size for a 2.4x scaling factor. If this is the only asset you provide then it will be scaled down for 1.4x and 1x scaling factors.\n\n     \n\n6.  In the **Background Color** field of the **Splash Screen** section, set the background color displayed with your splash screen image. You can enter either the name of a color or '\\#' and the hex value of a color. For a list of the names of available colors, see [**SplashScreen element**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211467).\n\n    Setting a background color for your splash screen is optional. If you don't specify a color for a UWP app, the splash screen background color defaults to a light gray (hex value \\#464646). This is the same color as the default **Tile** background color (see the **Background Color** field of the **Tile Images and Logos** section in the **Visual Assets** tab). If you don't specify a color for a Windows Phone, or set it to \"transparent\", then the splash screen background color will be transparent.\n\n## Summary and next steps\n\n\nIf your app takes a while to load, consider adding an extended splash screen.
