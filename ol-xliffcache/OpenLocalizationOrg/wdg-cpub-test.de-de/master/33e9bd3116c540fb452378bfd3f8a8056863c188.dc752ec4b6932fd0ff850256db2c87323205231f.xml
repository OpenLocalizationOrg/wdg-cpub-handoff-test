Through the picker, the user browses their system to pick files (or folders) to open or save to. Your app receives those picks as [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) and [**StorageFolder**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227230) objects, which you can then operate on.\n\nThe picker uses a single, unified interface to let the user pick files and folders from the files system or from other apps. Files picked from other apps are like files from the file system: they are returned as [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) objects. In general, your app can operate on them in the same ways as other such objects. Other apps make files available by participating in file picker contracts. If you want your app to provide files, a save location, or file updates to other apps, see [Integrating with file picker contracts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465192).\n\nFor example, you might call the file picker in your app so that your user can open a file. This makes your app the calling app. The file picker interacts with the system and/or other apps to let the user navigate and pick the file. When your user chooses a file, the file picker returns that file to your app. Here's the process for the case where the user chooses a file from another app, such as OneDrive. In this case OneDrive is the providing app.\n\n![a daigram that shows the process of one app getting a file to open from another app using the file picker as an interface bewteen the two apps.](images/app-to-app-diagram-600px.png)\n\n## Pick a single file to open it: complete code listing\n\n\n```CSharp\nvar picker = new Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker();\npicker.ViewMode = Windows.Storage.Pickers.PickerViewMode.Thumbnail;\npicker.SuggestedStartLocation = \n    Windows.Storage.Pickers.PickerLocationId.PicturesLibrary;\npicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(\".jpg\");\npicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(\".jpeg\");\npicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(\".png\");\n\nWindows.Storage.StorageFile file = await picker.PickSingleFileAsync();\nif (file != null)\n{\n    // Application now has read/write access to the picked file\n    this.textBlock.Text = \"Picked photo: \" + file.Name;\n}\nelse\n{\n    this.textBlock.Text = \"Operation cancelled.\";\n}\n```\n\nFor code to pick multiple files, see the [File picker sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619994).\n\n## Pick a single file to open it: step-by-step\n\n\nUsing a file picker involves creating and customizing a file picker object, and then showing the file picker so the user can pick one or more items.\n\n1.  **Create and customize a FileOpenPicker**\n\n```CSharp\nvar picker = new Windows.Storage.Pickers.FileOpenPicker();\n    picker.ViewMode = Windows.Storage.Pickers.PickerViewMode.Thumbnail;\n    picker.SuggestedStartLocation = \n        Windows.Storage.Pickers.PickerLocationId.PicturesLibrary;\n    picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(\".jpg\");\n    picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(\".jpeg\");\n    picker.FileTypeFilter.Add(\".png\");\n```\n\nSet properties on the file picker object that are relevant to your users and your app. For guidelines to help you decide how to customize the file picker, see [Guidelines and checklist for file pickers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh465182).\n\nThis example creates a rich, visual display of pictures in a convenient location that the user can pick from by setting three properties: [**ViewMode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207855), [**SuggestedStartLocation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207854), and [**FileTypeFilter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207850).\n\n-   Setting [**ViewMode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207855) to the **Thumbnail** [**PickerViewMode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.storage.pickers.pickerviewmode.aspx#thumbnail) enum value creates a rich, visual display by using picture thumbnails to represent files in the file picker.

Set **SuggestedStartLocation** to a location appropriate for the type of file being picked, for example Music, Pictures, Videos, or Documents. From the start location, the user can navigate to other locations.\n\n-   Using [**FileTypeFilter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207850) to specify file types keeps the user focused on picking files that are relevant. To replace previous file types in the **FileTypeFilter** with new entries, use [**ReplaceAll**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207844) instead of [**Add**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207834).\n\n2.  **Show the FileOpenPicker**\n\n    -   **To pick a single file**\n\n```CSharp\nWindows.Storage.StorageFile file = await picker.PickSingleFileAsync();\n        if (file != null)\n        {\n            // Application now has read/write access to the picked file\n            this.textBlock.Text = \"Picked photo: \" + file.Name;\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            this.textBlock.Text = \"Operation cancelled.\";\n        }\n```\n\n    -   **To pick multiple files**\n\n```CSharp\nvar files = await picker.PickMultipleFilesAsync();\n        if (files.Count > 0)\n        {\n            StringBuilder output = new StringBuilder(\"Picked files:\\n\");\n\n            // Application now has read/write access to the picked file(s)\n            foreach (Windows.Storage.StorageFile file in files)\n            {\n                output.Append(file.Name + \"\\n\");\n            }\n            this.textBlock.Text = output.ToString();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            this.textBlock.Text = \"Operation cancelled.\";\n        }\n```\n\n## Pick a folder: complete code listing\n\n\n```CSharp\nvar folderPicker = new Windows.Storage.Pickers.FolderPicker();\nfolderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = Windows.Storage.Pickers.PickerLocationId.Desktop;\n\nWindows.Storage.StorageFolder folder = await folderPicker.PickSingleFolderAsync();\nif (folder != null)\n{\n    // Application now has read/write access to all contents in the picked folder\n    // (including other sub-folder contents)\n    Windows.Storage.AccessCache.StorageApplicationPermissions.\n    FutureAccessList.AddOrReplace(\"PickedFolderToken\", folder);\n    this.textBlock.Text = \"Picked folder: \" + folder.Name;\n}\nelse\n{\n    this.textBlock.Text = \"Operation cancelled.\";\n}\n```\n\n**Tip**  Whenever your app accesses a file or folder through a picker, add it to your app's [**FutureAccessList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207457) or [**MostRecentlyUsedList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207458) to keep track of it. You can learn more about using these lists in [How to track recently-used files and folders](how-to-track-recently-used-files-and-folders.md).\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
