From the **Start** menu, search **Apps**, find **Windows Kits**, and click **Windows App Cert Kit**.\n\n2.  From the Windows App Certification Kit, select the category of validation you would like to perform. For example: If you are validating a Windows app, select **Validate a Windows app**.\n\n    You may browse directly to the app you're testing, or choose the app from a list in the UI. When the Windows App Certification Kit is run for the first time, the UI lists all the Windows apps that you have installed on your computer. For any subsequent runs, the UI will display the most recent Windows apps that you have validated. If the app that you want to test is not listed, you can click on **My app isn't listed** to get a comprehensive list of all apps installed on your system.\n\n3.

Enter the following commands in this order to test an app that is already installed on your test computer:\n\n    `appcert.exe reset`\n\n    `appcert.exe test -packagefullname [package full name] -reportoutputpath [report file name]`\n\n    Or you can use the following commands if the app is not installed. The Windows App Certification Kit will open the package and apply the appropriate test workflow:\n\n    `appcert.exe reset`\n\n    `appcert.exe test -appxpackagepath [package path] -reportoutputpath [report file name]`\n\n3.  After the test completes, open the report file named `[report file name]` and review the test results.\n\n**Note**  The Windows App Certification Kit can be run from a service, but the service must initiate the kit process within an active user session and cannot be run in Session0.\n\n**Note**   For more info about the Windows App Certification Kit command line, enter the command `appcert.exe /?`\n\n## Testing with a low-power computer\n\nThe performance test thresholds of the Windows App Certification Kit are based on the performance of a low-power computer.\n\nThe characteristics of the computer on which the test is performed can influence the test results.
