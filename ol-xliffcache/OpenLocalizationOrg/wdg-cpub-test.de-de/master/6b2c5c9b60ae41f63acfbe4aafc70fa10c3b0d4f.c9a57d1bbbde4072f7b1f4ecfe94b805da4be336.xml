For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nEntity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables you to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. This article explains how you can use Entity Framework 7 with a SQLite database in a Universal Windows app.\n\nOriginally for .NET developers, Entity Framework 7 can be used with SQLite on Universal Windows Platform (UWP) to store and manipulate relational data using domain specific objects. You can migrate EF code from a .NET app to a UWP app and expect it work with appropriate changes to the connection string.\n\nCurrently EF only supports SQLite on UWP. A detailed walkthrough on installing Entity Framework 7, and creating models is available at the [Getting Started on Universal Windows Platform page](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html). It covers the following topics:\n\n-   [Prerequisites](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html#prerequisites)\n-   [Create a new project](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html#create-a-new-project)\n-   [Install Entity Framework](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html#install-entity-framework)\n-   [Create your model](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html#create-your-model)\n-   [Create your database](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html#create-your-database)\n-   [Use your model](http://ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting-started/uwp.html#use-your-model)\n\n"}
