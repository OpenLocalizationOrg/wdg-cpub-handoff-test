To fix this, you need to update the affected settings using Group Policy Preferences, Administrative Templates (.admx), or IE Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11).\n\nBecause Group Policy Preferences and IEAK 11 run using asynchronous processes, you should choose to use only one of the tools within each group of settings. For example, using only IEAK 11 in the **Security** settings or Group Policy Preferences within the **Internet Zone** settings. Also, it's important to remember that policy is enforced and can't be changed by the user, while preferences are configured, but can be changed by the user.\n\nFor more information about all of the new options and Group Policy, see:\n\n-   [Group policy preferences and Internet Explorer 11](group-policy-preferences-and-ie11.md)\n\n-   [Administrative templates and Internet Explorer 11](administrative-templates-and-ie11.md)\n\n-   [Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 (IEAK 11) - Administration Guide for IT Pros](../ie11-ieak/index.md)\n\n-   [Group Policy Settings Reference for Windows and Windows Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=279876)\n\n-   [Group Policy ADMX Syntax Reference Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=276830)\n\n-   [Enable and Disable Settings in a Preference Item](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=282671)\n\n## IEM replacements\nThe IEM settings have replacements you can use in either Group Policy Preferences or IEAK 11.\n\n### Browser user interface replacements\n\n|IEM setting |Description |Replacement tool |\n|------------|------------|-----------------|\n|Browser title |Lets you customize the text that shows up in the title bar of the browser.|On the **Browser User Interface** page of IEAK 11, click **Customize Title Bars**, and then type the text that appears on the title bar of the **Title Bar Text** box.<p>Your text is appended to the text,\" Microsoft Internet Explorer provided by\". |\n|Browser toolbar customizations (background and buttons) |Lets you customize the buttons on the browser toolbar.<ul><li>**Buttons.** Customizes the buttons on the Internet Explorer 11 toolbar.</li><li>**Background.** No longer available.</li></ul> |On the **Browser User Interface** page of IEAK 11, click **Add**, type your new toolbar caption, action, and icon, and if the button should appear by default, and then click **OK**.
