The zoomed-in view is the main view of the content. You show the complete data set in this view. The zoomed-out view is a higher-level view of the same content. You typically show the group headers for a grouped data set in this view. For example, when viewing an address book, the user could zoom in on a letter and see the names associated with that letter. \n\n**Important APIs**\n\n-   [**SemanticZoom class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh702601)\n\n**Features**:\n\n-   The size of the zoomed-out view is constrained by the bounds of the semantic zoom control.\n-   Tapping on a group header toggles views.
