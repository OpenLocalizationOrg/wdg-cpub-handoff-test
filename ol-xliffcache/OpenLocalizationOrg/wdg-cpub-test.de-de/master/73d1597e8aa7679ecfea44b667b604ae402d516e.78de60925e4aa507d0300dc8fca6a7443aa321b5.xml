The common first step for each of the ways of writing to a file (unless you're writing to the file immediately after creating it) is to get the file with [**StorageFolder.GetFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227272).\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nWindows.Storage.StorageFolder storageFolder =\n    Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;\nWindows.Storage.StorageFile sampleFile =\n    await storageFolder.GetFileAsync(\"sample.txt\");\n```\n```vb\nDim storageFolder As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder\nDim sampleFile As StorageFile = Await storageFolder.GetFileAsync(\"sample.txt\")\n```\n\n**Writing text to a file**\n\nWrite text to your file by calling the [**WriteTextAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701505) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nawait Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteTextAsync(sampleFile, \"Swift as a shadow\");\n```\n```vb\nAwait Windows.Storage.FileIO.WriteTextAsync(sampleFile, \"Swift as a shadow\")\n```\n\n**Writing bytes to a file by using a buffer (2 steps)**\n\n1.  First, call [**ConvertStringToBinary**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241385) to get a buffer of the bytes (based on an arbitrary string) that you want to write to your file.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nvar buffer = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.ConvertStringToBinary(\n        \"What fools these mortals be\", Windows.Security.Cryptography.BinaryStringEncoding.Utf8);\n```\n```vb\nDim buffer = Windows.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicBuffer.ConvertStringToBinary(\n                    \"What fools these mortals be\",\n                    Windows.Security.Cryptography.BinaryStringEncoding.Utf8)\n```\n\n2.

First, open the file by calling the [**StorageFile.OpenAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn889851) method. It returns a stream of the file's content when the open operation completes.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nvar stream = await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite);\n```\n```vb\nDim stream = Await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite)\n```\n\n2.  Next, get an output stream by calling the [**GetOutputStreamAt**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241738) method from the `stream`. Put this in a **using** statement to manage the output stream's lifetime.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nusing (var outputStream = stream.GetOutputStreamAt(0))\n    {\n        // We'll add more code here in the next step.\n    }\n    stream.Dispose(); // Or use the stream variable (see previous code snippet) with a using statement as well.\n```\n```vb\nUsing outputStream = stream.GetOutputStreamAt(0)\n\n        ' We'll add more code here in the next step.\n\nEnd Using\n```\n\n3.  Now add this code within the existing **using** statement to write to the output stream by creating a new [**DataWriter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208154) object and calling the [**DataWriter.WriteString**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241642) method.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nusing (var dataWriter = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataWriter(outputStream))\n    {\n        dataWriter.WriteString(\"DataWriter has methods to write to various types, such as DataTimeOffset.\");\n    }\n```\n```vb\n    Dim dataWriter As New DataWriter(outputStream)\n\n        dataWriter.WriteString(\"DataWriter has methods to write to various types, such as DataTimeOffset.\")\n```\n\n4.  Lastly, add this code (within the inner **using** statement) to save the text to your file with [**StoreAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208171) and close the stream with [**FlushAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241729).\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\n    await dataWriter.StoreAsync();\n        await outputStream.FlushAsync(); \n```\n```vb\n    Await dataWriter.StoreAsync()\n        Await outputStream.FlushAsync()\n```\n\n## Reading from a file\n\n\nHere's how to read from a file on disk using the [**StorageFile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227171) class. The common first step for each of the ways of reading from a file is to get the file with [**StorageFolder.GetFileAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227272).\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nWindows.Storage.StorageFolder storageFolder =\n    Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder;\nWindows.Storage.StorageFile sampleFile =\n    await storageFolder.GetFileAsync(\"sample.txt\");\n```\n```vb\nDim storageFolder As StorageFolder = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder\nDim sampleFile As StorageFile = Await storageFolder.GetFileAsync(\"sample.txt\")\n```\n\n**Reading text from a file**\n\nRead text from your file by calling the [**ReadTextAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701482) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nstring text = await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadTextAsync(sampleFile);\n```\n```vb\nDim text As String = Await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadTextAsync(sampleFile)\n```\n\n**Reading bytes from a file by using a buffer (2 steps)**\n\n1.  First, read bytes from your buffer to your file by calling the [**ReadBufferAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701468) method of the [**FileIO**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701440) class.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nvar buffer = await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadBufferAsync(sampleFile);\n```\n```vb\nDim buffer = Await Windows.Storage.FileIO.ReadBufferAsync(sampleFile)\n```\n\n2.  Then use a [**DataReader**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208119) object to read first the length of the buffer and then its contents.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nusing (var dataReader = Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader.FromBuffer(buffer))\n    {\n        string text = dataReader.ReadString(buffer.Length);\n    }\n```\n```vb\nDim dataReader As DataReader = Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader.FromBuffer(buffer)\n    Dim text As String = dataReader.ReadString(buffer.Length)\n```\n\n**Reading text from a file by using a stream (4 steps)**\n\n1.  Open a stream for your file by calling the [**StorageFile.OpenAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn889851) method. It returns a stream of the file's content when the operation completes.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nvar stream = await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite);\n```\n```vb\nDim stream = Await sampleFile.OpenAsync(Windows.Storage.FileAccessMode.ReadWrite)\n```\n\n2.  Get the size of the stream to use later.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nulong size = stream.Size;\n```\n```vb\nDim size = stream.Size\n```\n\n3.  Get an input stream by calling the [**GetInputStreamAt**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br241737) method. Put this in a **using** statement to manage the stream's lifetime. Specify 0 when you call **GetInputStreamAt** to set the position to the beginning of the stream.\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nusing (var inputStream = stream.GetInputStreamAt(0))\n    {\n        // We'll add more code here in the next step.\n    }\n```\n```vb\nUsing inputStream = stream.GetInputStreamAt(0)\n\n        ' We'll add more code here in the next step.\n\n    End Using\n```\n\n4.  Lastly, add this code within the existing **using** statement to get a [**DataReader**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208119) object on the stream then read the text by calling [**DataReader.LoadAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208135) and [**DataReader.ReadString**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208147).\n> [!div class=\"tabbedCodeSnippets\"]\n```CSharp\nusing (var dataReader = new Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader(inputStream))\n    {\n        uint numBytesLoaded = await dataReader.LoadAsync((uint)size);\n        string text = dataReader.ReadString(numBytesLoaded);\n    }\n```\n```vb\nDim dataReader As New DataReader(inputStream)\n    Dim numBytesLoaded As UInteger = Await dataReader.LoadAsync(CUInt(size))\n    Dim text As String = dataReader.ReadString(numBytesLoaded)\n```\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
