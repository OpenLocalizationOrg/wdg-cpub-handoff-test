The preferred way to do this is by using the built-in support in the cbx build command.  Here's how:\n\n\n1. Go to [IDWeb](https://idweb/identitymanagement/aspx/groups/AllGroups.aspx) and ensure that you are a member of the MSDN Reporting SG for your domain.  You may need to wait up to 24 hours for permissions to propagate.\n\n1.  Install the latest release of [ Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases).  Pandoc is updated periodically, so if it's been a while since you installed it, consider upgrading.  A recent fix improved table rendering, for example.  By default, Pandoc installs to `c:\\Users\\<alias>\\AppData\\Local\\Pandoc\\`, which is added to your PATH.\n\n1. Do an `sd sync`.\n\n2. Use `cbx msdn markdown` to build your project into .md files.\n\n * After the regular cbx build, you will see two passes with progress bars.  The first is a fast pass to change .md formatting to match OP requirements.  The second is the A keyword conversion to URLs, which takes significantly longer.  The whole conversion can take up to an hour for a project containing 1500 topics.\n * If the database pass fails, you will see:\n          Error connecting to db server.  Ensure that you have perms on the MSDN Reporting SG.\n * Sometimes database access can be problematic.  If you can't connect, try again a couple hours later.\n * PROTIP: On rare occasions (ask Jason), you may need to update the local version of `convert-keywords.ps1` with the fully qualified name of the reporting server: reporting.mtps.glbdns2.microsoft.com.\n\nManual Conversion\n-----\n\n\nIf you have problems with the automation, please send a bug report to DDPUB.  \n\nThe following steps are what the first pass above does.  They are listed here for posterity.  \n\n1. Fix links as follows:\n    * Replace .htm link suffixes with .md, for in-project targets, for example:\n        * `[Creating a Driver From Existing Source Files](creating_a_driver_from_existing_source_files.htm)`.  \n    * Replace A keywords with URLs, for example:\n        * `[Kernel-Mode Driver Framework](kmdf.portal)`\n        * `<a href=\"wmi.mofcomp\"><strong>mofcomp</strong></a>`\n    * Remove In This Section links at the top\n\n2. Switch references to upper case Images directory to images: `![Visual Studio Solution Explorer Driver Package Project](images/VsSlnExplorer.png)`\n\n3. Remove any %20 in URLs if they exist: `[MSBuild](%20http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=262804)`\n\n4. If See Also section is present, prepend asterisks to create bulleted list.\n\n8. If existing, delete second occurrence of local target string: `[Manually installing WDTF on a test computer](dtf.runtime_library#manual_install_wdtf#manual_install_wdtf)`\n\n9. Update embedded video links from: `![]()`\nto look like this:\n\n    ```\n    <iframe src=\"https://hubs-video.ssl.catalog.video.msn.com/embed/57464a96-8900-4194-b806-813eb1dd6ac6/IA?csid=ux-en-us&MsnPlayerLeadsWith=html&PlaybackMode=Inline&MsnPlayerDisplayShareBar=false&MsnPlayerDisplayInfoButton=false&iframe=true&QualityOverride=HD\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" frameBorder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n    ```\n    **Note**:  JasGro to follow up on video plans and correct URL\n\n10. Remove initial span so that OP creates correct topic title for text on browser tab: `<span id=\"vsdriver.avoiding_floating_point_errors_in_custom_build_environments\"></span>`\n\n11. Remove nested parenthetical version selector (v=vs.85, e.g.) from links: `[InfVerif](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Dn929319(v=vs.85).aspx)`\n\n12. (Hardware team only) For mailto links, replace nested parentheses with %28, %29: `[Send comments about this topic to Microsoft](mailto:wsddocfb@microsoft.com?subject=Documentation%20feedback%20[VsDriver\\vsdriver]:%20Analyzing%20a%20Driver%20Using%20Code%20Analysis%20and%20Verification%20Tools%20%20RELEASE:%20(9/30/2015)&body=...` Topics that contain parentheses in the topic title also cause additional parentheses in the mailto link: `[Send comments about this topic to Microsoft](mailto:wsddocfb@microsoft.com?subject=Documentation%20feedback%20[VsDriver\\vsdriver]:%20What%20happens%20when%20you%20provision%20a%20computer%20(WDK%208.0)%20%20RELEASE:%20%289/30/2015%29`\n\n14. Remove extra carriage returns that occur after a **Note** inside a numbered list item, because it causes OP to start numbering again from 1. Leave one blank line remaining.\n\n15. Remove copyright line: `© 2015 Microsoft. All rights reserved.`\n\n16. Change any image file suffixes to lower case, e.g., *.png not *.PNG.\n\n## Post-markdown conversion steps\n\n1. Create TOC.md in parent directory.\n"}
