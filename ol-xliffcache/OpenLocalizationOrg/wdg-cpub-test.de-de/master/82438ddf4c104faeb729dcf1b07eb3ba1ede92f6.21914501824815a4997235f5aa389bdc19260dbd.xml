This is why two different XAML syntaxes are shown.\n\n**RelativeSource** is similar to [{Binding} markup extension](binding-markup-extension.md) in that it is a markup extension that is capable of returning instances of itself, supporting a string-based construction that essentially passes an argument to the constructor. In this case, the argument being passed is the [**Mode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209915) value.\n\nThe **Self** mode is useful for cases where the same element should be used as the source object and target object for a binding, but different properties are the source and the target. This is useful for binding one property of an element to another property on the same element, and is a variation on [**ElementName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209828) binding that does not require naming and then self-referencing the element. If you bind one property of an element to another property on the same element, either the properties must use the same property type, or you must also use a [**Converter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209826) on the binding to convert the values. For example, you could use [**Height**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208718) as a source for [**Width**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208751) without conversion, but you'd need a converter to use [**IsEnabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209419) as a source for [**Visibility**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209006).\n\nHere's an example. This [**Rectangle**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br243371) uses a [{Binding} markup extension](binding-markup-extension.md) so that its [**Height**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208718) and [**Width**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208751) are always equal and it renders as a square. Only the Height is set as a fixed value. For this **Rectangle** its default [**DataContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208713) is **null**, not **this**. So to establish the data context source to be the object itself (and enable binding to its other properties) we use the `RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}` argument in the {Binding} markup extension usage.\n\n```XAML\n<Rectangle\n  Fill=\"Orange\" Width=\"200\"\n  Height=\"{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}, Path=Width}\"\n/>\n```\n\nAnother technique that can be useful is to use `RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}` as a way to set an object's [**DataContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208713) to itself, where the [**Page**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227503) class has been extended with a custom property that's already providing a ready-to-go view model for its own data binding. You see this technique in some of the SDK examples: `<common:LayoutAwarePage ... DataContext=\"{Binding DefaultViewModel, RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self}}\">`\n\n**Note**  The XAML usage for **RelativeSource** shows only the usage for which it is intended: setting a value for [**Binding.RelativeSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209831) in XAML as part of a binding expression. Theoretically, other usages are possible if setting a property where the value is [**RelativeSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209913).\n\n## Related topics\n\n* [XAML overview](xaml-overview.md)\n* [Data binding in depth](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt210946)\n* [{Binding} markup extension](binding-markup-extension.md)\n* [**Binding**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209820)\n* [**RelativeSource**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209913)\n\n"}
