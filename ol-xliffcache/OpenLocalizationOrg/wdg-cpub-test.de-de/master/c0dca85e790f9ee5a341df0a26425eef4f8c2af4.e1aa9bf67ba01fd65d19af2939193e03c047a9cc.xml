Bluetooth RFCOMM\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n** Important APIs **\n\n-   [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263413)\n-   [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.Rfcomm**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263529)\n\nThis article provides an overview of Bluetooth RFCOMM in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, along with example code on how to send or receive a file..\n\n## Overview\n\nThe APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.Rfcomm**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263529) namespace build on existing patterns for Windows.Devices, including [**enumeration**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR225459) and [**instantiation**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR225654). Data reading and writing is designed to take advantage of [**established data stream patterns**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR208119) and objects in [**Windows.Storage.Streams**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR241791). Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes have a value and an expected type. However, some common devices have faulty implementations of SDP attributes where the value is not of the expected type. Additionally, many usages of RFCOMM do not require additional SDP attributes at all. For these reasons, this API offers access to the unparsed SDP data, from which developers can obtain the information they need.\n\nThe RFCOMM APIs use the concept of service identifiers. Although a service identifier is simply a 128-bit GUID, it is also commonly specified as either a 16- or 32-bit integer. The RFCOMM API offers a wrapper for service identifiers that allows them be specified and consumed as 128-bit GUIDs as well as 32-bit integers but does not offer 16-bit integers. This is not an issue for the API because languages will automatically upsize to a 32-bit integer and the identifier can still be correctly generated.\n\nApps can perform multi-step device operations in a background task so that they can run to completion even if the app is moved to the background and suspended. This allows for reliable device servicing such as changes to persistent settings or firmware, and content synchronization, without requiring the user to sit and watch a progress bar. Use the [**DeviceServicingTrigger**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn297315) for device servicing and the [**DeviceUseTrigger**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn297337) for content synchronization. Note that these background tasks constrain the amount of time the app can run in the background, and are not intended to allow indefinite operation or infinite synchronization.\n\n## Send a file as a client\n\nWhen sending a file, the most basic scenario is to connect to a paired device based on a desired service. This involves the following steps:\n\n-   Use the **RfcommDeviceService.GetDeviceSelector\\*** functions to help generate an AQS query that can be used to enumerated paired device instances of the desired service.\n-   Pick an enumerated device, create an [**RfcommDeviceService**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263463), and read the SDP attributes as needed (using [**established data helpers**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR208119) to parse the attribute's data).\n-   Create a socket and use the [**RfcommDeviceService.ConnectionHostName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.bluetooth.rfcomm.rfcommdeviceservice.connectionhostname.aspx) and [**RfcommDeviceService.ConnectionServiceName**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.devices.bluetooth.rfcomm.rfcommdeviceservice.connectionservicename.aspx) properties to [**StreamSocket.ConnectAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh701504) to the remote device service with the appropriate parameters.\n-   Follow established data stream patterns to read chunks of data from the file and send it on the socket's [**StreamSocket.OutputStream**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR226920) to the device.\n\n```csharp\nWindows.Devices.Bluetooth.RfcommDeviceService _service;\nWindows.Networking.Sockets.StreamSocket _socket;\n\nasync void Initialize()\n{\n    // Enumerate devices with the object push service\n    auto services =\n        await Windows.Devices.Enumeration.DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync(\n            RfcommDeviceService.GetDeviceSelector(\n                RfcommServiceId.ObexObjectPush));\n\n    if (services.Count > 0) \n    {\n        // Initialize the target Bluetooth BR device\n        auto service = await RfcommDeviceService.FromIdAsync(services[0].Id);\n\n        // Check that the service meets this App’s minimum requirement\n        if (SupportsProtection(service) &amp;&amp; IsCompatibleVersion(service))\n        {\n            _service = service;\n\n            // Create a socket and connect to the target\n            _socket = new StreamSocket();\n            await _socket.ConnectAsync(\n                _service.ConnectionHostName,\n                _service.ConnectionServiceName,\n                SocketProtectionLevel\n                    .BluetoothEncryptionAllowNullAuthentication);\n\n            // The socket is connected.
