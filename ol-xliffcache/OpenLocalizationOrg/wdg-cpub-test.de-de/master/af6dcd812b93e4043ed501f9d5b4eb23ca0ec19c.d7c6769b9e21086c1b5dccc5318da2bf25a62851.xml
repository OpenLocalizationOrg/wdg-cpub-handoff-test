The **TileNotification** constructor takes a Windows Runtime [**XmlDocument**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208620) object, which you can obtain from the **TileContent.GetXml** method if you're using [NotificationsExtensions](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/NotificationsExtensions/wiki).\n\nThis code example creates a notification for a new tile.\n\n```\n// Create the tile notification\nvar notification = new TileNotification(content.GetXml());\n```\n\n## <span id=\"Set_an_expiration_time_for_the_notification__optional_\"></span><span id=\"set_an_expiration_time_for_the_notification__optional_\"></span><span id=\"SET_AN_EXPIRATION_TIME_FOR_THE_NOTIFICATION__OPTIONAL_\"></span>Set an expiration time for the notification (optional)\n\n\nBy default, local tile and badge notifications don't expire, while push, periodic, and scheduled notifications expire after three days. Because tile content shouldn't persist longer than necessary, it's a best practice to set an expiration time that makes sense for your app, especially on local tile and badge notifications.\n\nThis code example creates a notification that expires and will be removed from the tile after ten minutes.\n\n```\ntileNotification.ExpirationTime = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(10);</code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\n## <span id=\"Send_the_notification\"></span><span id=\"send_the_notification\"></span><span id=\"SEND_THE_NOTIFICATION\"></span>Send the notification\n\n\nAlthough locally sending a tile notification is simple, sending the notification to a primary or secondary tile is a bit different.\n\n**Primary tile**\n\nTo send a notification to a primary tile, use the [**TileUpdateManager**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208622) to create a tile updater for the primary tile, and send the notification by calling \"Update\". Regardless of whether it's visible, your app's primary tile always exists, so you can send notifications to it even when it's not pinned.

If you try to create a tile updater for a secondary tile that doesn't exist (for example, if the user unpinned the secondary tile), an exception will be thrown. You can use [**SecondaryTile.Exists**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242205)(tileId) to discover if your secondary tile is pinned, and then create a tile updater for the secondary tile and send the notification.\n\nThis code example sends a notification to a secondary tile.\n\n```\n// If the secondary tile is pinned\nif (SecondaryTile.Exists(\"MySecondaryTile\"))\n{\n    // Get its updater\n    var updater = TileUpdateManager.CreateTileUpdaterForSecondaryTile(\"MySecondaryTile\");\n \n    // And send the notification\n    updater.Update(notification);\n}\n```\n\n![default tile and tile with notification](images/sending-local-tile-01.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Clear_notifications_on_the_tile__optional_\"></span><span id=\"clear_notifications_on_the_tile__optional_\"></span><span id=\"CLEAR_NOTIFICATIONS_ON_THE_TILE__OPTIONAL_\"></span>Clear notifications on the tile (optional)\n\n\nIn most cases, you should clear a notification once the user has interacted with that content. For example, when the user launches your app, you might want to clear all the notifications from the tile.

You can't, however, clear a notification via your app's server; only the local app code can clear notifications.\n\nPeriodic or push notifications can only add new notifications or replace existing notifications. A local call to the Clear method will clear the tile whether or not the notifications themselves came via push, periodic, or local. Scheduled notifications that haven't yet appeared are not cleared by this method.\n\n![tile with notification and tile after being cleared](images/sending-local-tile-03.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Next_steps\"></span><span id=\"next_steps\"></span><span id=\"NEXT_STEPS\"></span>Next steps\n\n\n**Using the notification queue**\n\nNow that you have done your first tile update, you can expand the functionality of the tile by enabling a [notification queue](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh868234).\n\n**Other notification delivery methods**\n\nThis article shows you how to send the tile update as a notification. To explore other methods of notification delivery, including scheduled, periodic, and push, see [Delivering notifications](tiles-and-notifications-choosing-a-notification-delivery-method.md).\n\n**XmlEncode delivery method**\n\nIf you're not using [NotificationsExtensions](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/NotificationsExtensions/wiki), this notification delivery method is another alternative.\n\n<span codelanguage=\"\"></span>\n```\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"100%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\npublic string XmlEncode(string text)\n{\n    StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();\n    using (var writer = XmlWriter.Create(builder))\n    {\n        writer.WriteString(text);\n    }\n\n    return builder.ToString();\n}\n```\n\n## <span id=\"Code_examples_without_NotificationsExtensions\"></span><span id=\"code_examples_without_notificationsextensions\"></span><span id=\"CODE_EXAMPLES_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATIONSEXTENSIONS\"></span>Code examples without NotificationsExtensions\n\n\nIf you prefer to work with raw XML instead of the [NotificationsExtensions](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/NotificationsExtensions/wiki) NuGet package, use these alternate code examples to first three examples provided in this article. The rest of the code examples can be used either with [NotificationsExtensions](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/NotificationsExtensions/wiki) or with raw XML.\n\nAdd namespace declarations\n\n```\nusing Windows.UI.Notifications;\nusing Windows.Data.Xml.Dom;\n```\n\nCreate the notification content\n\n```\n// In a real app, these would be initialized with actual data\nstring from = \"Jennifer Parker\";\nstring subject = \"Photos from our trip\";\nstring body = \"Check out these awesome photos I took while in New Zealand!\";\n \n \n// TODO - all values need to be XML escaped\n \n \n// Construct the tile content as a string\nstring content = $@\"\n<tile>\n    <visual>\n \n        <binding template=&#39;TileMedium&#39;>\n            <text>{from}</text>\n            <text hint-style=&#39;captionSubtle&#39;>{subject}</text>\n            <text hint-style=&#39;captionSubtle&#39;>{body}</text>\n        </binding>\n \n        <binding template=&#39;TileWide&#39;>\n            <text hint-style=&#39;subtitle&#39;>{from}</text>\n            <text hint-style=&#39;captionSubtle&#39;>{subject}</text>\n            <text hint-style=&#39;captionSubtle&#39;>{body}</text>\n        </binding>\n \n    </visual>\n</tile>\";\n```\n\nCreate the notification\n\n```\n// Load the string into an XmlDocument\nXmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();\ndoc.LoadXml(content);\n \n// Then create the tile notification\nvar notification = new TileNotification(doc);\n```\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related topics\n\n\n* [Create adaptive tiles](tiles-and-notifications-create-adaptive-tiles.md)\n* [Adaptive tile templates: schema and documentation](tiles-and-notifications-adaptive-tiles-schema.md)\n* [NotificationsExtensions.Win10 (NuGet package)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NotificationsExtensions.Win10/)\n* [NotificationsExtensions on GitHub](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/NotificationsExtensions/wiki)\n* [Full code sample on GitHub](https://github.com/WindowsNotifications/quickstart-sending-local-tile-win10)\n* [**Windows.UI.Notifications namespace**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208661)\n* [How to use the notification queue (XAML)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/hh868234)\n* [Delivering notifications](tiles-and-notifications-choosing-a-notification-delivery-method.md)\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
