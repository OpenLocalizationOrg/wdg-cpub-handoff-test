and conversions** report in the Windows Dev Center dashboard lets you see how customers on Windows 10 have arrived at your app's listing.

It also shows the number of conversions from custom campaigns over the selected period of time.\n\nThe **Page views** tab of this chart shows the number of times your app's listing page was viewed over the selected period of time. Views are grouped according to the type of channel by which the customer found your app's listing.\n\nThe **Conversions** tab of this chart shows the number of conversions (new acquisitions) over the selected period of time for customers who arrived at your app's listing via a custom campaign.\n\n**Note**  For info about all of your app's acquisitions, including those that did not occur via a custom campaign link and those from customers on other OS versions, see the [Acquisitions report](acquisitions-report.md).\n\n \n\n## Campaign performance by channel\n\n\nThe **Campaign performance by channel** chart shows the number of page views for each channel type.

To view data for a specific IAP, select it from the **Section filters**.\n\n## Conversions breakdown\n\n\nThe **Conversions breakdown** chart shows more details about the page views that resulted from each of your channel types.
