So consider adding picked files to your app's MRU as soon as they are picked. Here's how.\n\n    ```CSharp\n    ...\n    \n    Windows.Storage.StorageFile file = await picker.PickSingleFileAsync();\n\n    var mru = Windows.Storage.AccessCache.StorageApplicationPermissions.MostRecentlyUsedList;\n    string mruToken = mru.Add(file, \"profile pic\");\n    ```\n    \n    [**StorageItemMostRecentlyUsedList.Add**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207476) is overloaded. In the example, we use [**Add(IStorageItem, String)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207481) so that we can associate metadata with the file. Setting metadata lets you record the item's purpose, for example \"profile pic\". You can also add the file to the MRU without metadata by calling [**Add(IStorageItem)**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207480). When you add an item to the MRU, the method returns a uniquely identifying string, called a token, which is used to retrieve the item.\n\n    **Tip**   You'll need the token to retrieve an item from the MRU, so persist it somewhere.

These entries are [**AccessListEntry**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227348) structures that contain the token and metadata for an item.\n\n## Removing items from the MRU when it's full\n\nWhen the MRU's 25-item limit is reached and you try to add a new item, the item that was accessed the longest time ago is automatically removed. So, you never need to remove an item before you add a new one.\n\n## Future-access list\n\nAs well as an MRU, your app also has a future-access list. By picking files and folders, your user grants your app permission to access items that might not be accessible otherwise. If you add these items to your future-access list then you'll retain that permission when your app wants to access those items again later. Your app's future-access list is represented by the [**StorageItemAccessList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207459) class, which you obtain from the static [**StorageApplicationPermissions.FutureAccessList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207457) property.\n\nWhen a user picks an item, consider adding it to your future-access list as well as your MRU.\n\n-   The [**FutureAccessList**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br207457) can hold up to 1000 items.
