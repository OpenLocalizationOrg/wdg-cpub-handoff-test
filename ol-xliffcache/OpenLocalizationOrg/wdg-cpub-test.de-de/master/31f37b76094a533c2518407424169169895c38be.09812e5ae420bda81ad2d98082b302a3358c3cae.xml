If you don't provide a launch argument, the app is launched to the main screen.\n\nHere, we add an [**AppLaunchArgument**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974183) parameter with a value of \"Las Vegas\" to a [**VoiceCommandResponse**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974182) object used in the [**ReportSuccessAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn706580) call of the [**VoiceCommandServiceConnection**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974204). object\n\n```CSharp\nvar userMessage = new VoiceCommandUserMessage();\nstring keepingTripToDestination = string.Format(\n  cortanaResourceMap.GetValue(\"KeepingTripToDestination\", \n    cortanaContext).ValueAsString, destination);\nuserMessage.DisplayMessage = userMessage.SpokenMessage = \n  keepingTripToDestination;\n\nresponse = VoiceCommandResponse.CreateResponse(userMessage);\nresponse.AppLaunchArgument = “Las Vegas”;\nawait voiceServiceConnection.ReportSuccessAsync(response);\n```\n\n## <span id=\"Content_tile_deep_link\"></span><span id=\"content_tile_deep_link\"></span><span id=\"CONTENT_TILE_DEEP_LINK\"></span>Content tile deep link\n\n\nYou can provide full content tile deep links on various **Cortana** screens.\n\n![cortana background app hand-off screen ](images/cortana-backgroundapp-progress-result.png)\n\nLike the \"Go to &lt;app&gt;\" links, you can provide a launch argument to open your app with similar context as the app service. If you don't provide a launch argument, the content tile is not linked to your app.\n\nHere, we add two content tiles with different [**AppLaunchArgument**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974183) parameter values to a [**VoiceCommandContentTile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974168) list used in the [**ReportSuccessAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn706580) call of the [**VoiceCommandServiceConnection**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974204) object.\n\n```CSharp\nvar userMessage = new VoiceCommandUserMessage();\nuserMessage.DisplayMessage = \"Here are your trips.\";\nuserMessage.SpokenMessage = \n  \"You have two trips to Vegas coming up.\";\n\nvar destinationsContentTiles = new List<VoiceCommandContentTile>();\n\nvar destinationTile1 = new VoiceCommandContentTile();\ndestinationTile1.ContentTileType = \n  VoiceCommandContentTileType.TitleWith68x68IconAndText;\ndestinationTile1.AppLaunchArgument = “id_Vegas_001\";\ndestinationTile1.Title = \"Las Vegas Tech Conference\";\ndestinationTile1.TextLine1 = \"May 15th 2015\";\ndestinationsContentTiles.Add(destinationTile1);\n\nvar destinationTile2 = new VoiceCommandContentTile();\ndestinationTile2.ContentTileType = \n  VoiceCommandContentTileType.TitleWith68x68IconAndText;\ndestinationTile2.AppLaunchArgument = “id_Vegas_002\";\ndestinationTile2.Title = \"Fun in Vegas\";\ndestinationTile2.TextLine1 = \"August 24th 2015\";\ndestinationsContentTiles.Add(destinationTile2);\n\nvar response = \n  VoiceCommandResponse.CreateResponse(userMessage, destinationsContentTiles);\n\nresponse.AppLaunchArgument = “destination=Las Vegas\";\n    \nawait voiceServiceConnection.ReportSuccessAsync(response);\n```\n\n## <span id=\"Programmatic_deep_link\"></span><span id=\"programmatic_deep_link\"></span><span id=\"PROGRAMMATIC_DEEP_LINK\"></span>Programmatic deep link\n\n\nYou can also programmatically launch your app with a launch argument to open your app with similar context as the app service. If you don't provide a launch argument, the app is launched to the main screen.\n\nHere, we add an [**AppLaunchArgument**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974183) parameter with a value of \"Las Vegas\" to a [**VoiceCommandResponse**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974182) object used in the [**RequestAppLaunchAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn706581) call of the [**VoiceCommandServiceConnection**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974204) object.\n\n```CSharp\nvar userMessage = new VoiceCommandUserMessage();\nuserMessage.DisplayMessage = \"Here are your trips.\";\nuserMessage.SpokenMessage = \n  \"You have one trip to Vegas coming up.\";\n\nresponse = VoiceCommandResponse.CreateResponse(userMessage);\nresponse.AppLaunchArgument = “Las Vegas”;\nawait  VoiceCommandServiceConnection.RequestAppLaunchAsync(response);\n```\n\n## <span id=\"App_manifest\"></span><span id=\"app_manifest\"></span><span id=\"APP_MANIFEST\"></span>App manifest\n\n\nTo enable deep linking to your app, you must declare the `windows.personalAssistantLaunch` extension in the Package.appxmanifest file of your app project.\n\nHere, we declare the `windows.personalAssistantLaunch` extension for the **Adventure Works** app.\n\n```XML\n<Extensions>\n  <uap:Extension Category=\"windows.appService\" \n    EntryPoint=\"AdventureWorks.VoiceCommands.AdventureWorksVoiceCommandService\">\n    <uap:AppService Name=\"AdventureWorksVoiceCommandService\"/>\n  </uap:Extension>\n  <uap:Extension Category=\"windows.personalAssistantLaunch\"/> \n</Extensions>\n```\n\n## <span id=\"Protocol_contract\"></span><span id=\"protocol_contract\"></span><span id=\"PROTOCOL_CONTRACT\"></span>Protocol contract\n\n\nYour app is launched to the foreground through Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) activation using a [**Protocol**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224693) contract. Your app must override your app's [**OnActivated**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242330) event and check for an **ActivationKind** of **Protocol**. For more info, see [Handle URI activation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt228339).\n\nHere, we decode the URI provided by the [**ProtocolActivatedEventArgs**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224742) to access the launch argument. For this example, the [**Uri**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224746) is set to \"windows.personalassistantlaunch:?LaunchContext=Las Vegas\".\n\n```CSharp\nif (args.Kind == ActivationKind.Protocol)\n  {\n    var commandArgs = args as ProtocolActivatedEventArgs;\n    Windows.Foundation.WwwFormUrlDecoder decoder = \n      new Windows.Foundation.WwwFormUrlDecoder(commandArgs.Uri.Query);\n    var destination = decoder.GetFirstValueByName(\"LaunchContext\");\n\n    navigationCommand = new ViewModel.TripVoiceCommand(\n      \"protocolLaunch\",\n      \"text\",\n      \"destination\",\n      destination);\n\n    navigationToPageType = typeof(View.TripDetails);\n\n    rootFrame.Navigate(navigationToPageType, navigationCommand);\n\n    // Ensure the current window is active.\n    Window.Current.Activate();\n  }\n```\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related articles\n\n\n**Developers**\n* [Cortana interactions](cortana-interactions.md)\n* [**VCD elements and attributes v1.2**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn706593)\n\n**Designers**\n* [Cortana design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn974233)\n* [Speech design guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn596121)\n\n**Samples**\n* [Cortana voice command sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=619899)\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
