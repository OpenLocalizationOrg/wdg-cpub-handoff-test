You can upload packages for any operating system that your app targets in this step. When a customer downloads your app, the Store will look through all of your app's available packages and will automatically provide each customer with the package that works best for their device.\n\nFor details about what a package includes and how it must be structured, see [App package requirements](app-package-requirements.md).

The **Packages** page will let you upload .xap, .appx, .appxupload, and/or .appxbundle files.\n\n**Note**  For Windows 10, you should always upload the .appxupload file here, not the .appx or .appxbundle.

Often this happens when you have previously uploaded packages, and now you are providing higher-versioned packages that support the same set of customers. In this case, no customers would ever get the redundant package, because you now have a better (higher-versioned) package to support these customers.\n\nWhen we detect that you have redundant packages, we'll provide an option to remove all of the redundant packages from this submission automatically.
