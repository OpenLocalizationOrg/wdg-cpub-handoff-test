Only one screenshot is required for your submission (though you can provide several; up to 8 mobile screenshots and up to 9 desktop screenshots). You are not required to provide separate screenshots for each device type, but we recommend providing screenshots on as many device types as your app supports, so that customers will see images that resemble how the app will look on their device.\n\n**Note**  Microsoft Visual Studio provides a [tool to help you capture these screenshots](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=221135).\n\n\nEach screenshot must be a .png file in either landscape or portrait orientation, and the file size can't be larger than 2 MB.\n\nFor mobile screenshots, each screenshot must be either 768 x 1280, 720 x 1280, or 480 x 800 pixels. For desktop, each screenshot should be at least 768 x 1366 pixels for best display.\n\nYou can provide a short caption that describes each screenshot in 200 characters or less.\n\n**Note**  If your app [supports multiple languages](supported-languages.md), you'll have a **Description** page for each language. You'll need to upload images for each language separately, including captions to use for each language.\n\n\n## App tile icon\n\nThis is not required for all submissions, but is strongly recommended if your app runs on Windows Phone 8.1 or earlier. The app tile icon is used when displaying your app's listing to customers on Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier. If you don't provide this image, customers on Windows Phone 8.1 or earlier will see a blank icon with your app's listing. (This also applies to customers on Windows 10, if your app only has packages targeting Windows Phone 8.1 or earlier.)\n\nThe app tile icon must be a .png file measuring 300 x 300 pixels.\n\n## Promotional artwork\n\n\nThe Windows Store editorial team uses different images to showcase apps in the Store. Submitting promotional artwork lets the Windows Store team consider your app in promotional layouts.\n\n**Important**  Providing promotional images for your app doesn't guarantee that your app will be featured, but not providing them means that it can't be considered for all promotional opportunities. (See [Making your app easy to promote](make-your-app-easier-to-promote.md) for more information.)\n\n\nYou may want to submit promotional artwork in different sizes, depending on which OS version(s) your app targets. For all sizes, images must be in .png format.\n\nHere are some tips to keep in mind when designing your promotional artwork:\n\n-   Select dynamic images that relate to the app and drive recognition and differentiation. Avoid stock photography or generic visuals.\n-   Don't include text (aside from your branding).\n-   Minimize empty space in the image.\n-   Avoid showing your app's UI, and do not use any device-specific imagery.\n-   Avoid political and national themes, flags, or religious symbols.\n-   Don't include images of insensitive gestures, nudity, gambling, currency, drugs, tobacco, or alcohol.\n-   Don't use weapons pointing at the viewer or excessive violence and gore.\n\n### For Windows 10: 2400 x 1200\n\nIn the Store on Windows 10, the top of the Apps and Games category pages features a rotating Spotlight image to promote content. To make your app eligible for this Spotlight placement, be sure to submit a 2400 x 1200 image.\n\nWhen designing your image, keep in mind that if we use it for the Spotlight, we'll apply a gradient over the bottom third so that we can legibly display marketing text over the image. Because of this, make sure you avoid placing text and key visual elements in the bottom third. Additionally, we may crop your image, so place your app's branding and the most important details in the center.\n\nThe image below shows the key proportions to keep in mind. The \"safe zone\" in the center will be prominent even if we crop the image. The \"dynamic text area\" is where text and a gradient may appear.\n\n![guidelines for spotlight image](images/spotlight1.jpg)\nThe example below shows a well-designed Spotlight image which keeps these guidelines in mind. (The lines on the image are to illustrate how the artwork fits into the designated areas, and would not be included in the final image.)\n\n![well-designed spotlight image](images/spotlight2.jpg)\n### For Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier: 1000 x 800, 358 x 358\n\nIn the Store on Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier, two image sizes can be used in promotional layouts: 1000 x 800 pixels and 358 x 358 pixels.
