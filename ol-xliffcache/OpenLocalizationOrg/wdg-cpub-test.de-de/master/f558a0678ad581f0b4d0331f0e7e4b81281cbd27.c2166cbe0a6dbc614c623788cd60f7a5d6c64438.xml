and services\n\nYou can manage and view details related to each of your apps in the Windows Dev Center dashboard, and configure services such as push notifications and Maps.\n\nWhen working with an app in your dashboard, you'll see sections in the left navigation menu for Services and App management. You can expand these sections to access the functionality described below.\n\n## Services\n\nThe **Services** section lets you manage certain types of push notifications and map services.\n\n### Push notifications\n\nDepending on your app's package type and its specific requirements, you can use one of the following options for push notifications:\n\n-   **Windows Push Notification Services (WNS)** lets you send toast, tile, badge, and raw updates from your own cloud service. For more info, see [Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt187203).\n\n**Microsoft Azure Mobile Services** lets you send push notifications, authenticate and manage app users, and store app data in the cloud. For more info, see the [Mobile Services documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=221116).\n\n**Microsoft Push Notifications Service (MPNS)** can be used with your .xap packages for Windows Phone. You can send a limited number of unauthenticated notifications without doing any configuration here, although we recommend using authenticated notifications to avoid throttling limits. If you're using MPNS, you'll need to upload a certificate to the field provided on the **Push notifications** page. For more info, see [Setting up an authenticated web service to send push notifications for Windows Phone 8](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=528736).\n\n### Maps\n\nTo use map services in apps for Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier, you need a map service application ID and a token to include in your app's code. You can get this token on the **Maps** page in the **Services** section.\n\n**Note**  To use map services in apps targeting other operating systems, visit the [Bing Maps Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614880). See [Request a maps authentication key](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt219694) for more info.\n\nFor more info, see [Use map services](use-map-services.md).\n\n### Product collections and purchases\n\nTo use the Windows Store collection API and the Windows Store purchase API to access ownership information for apps and IAPs, you need to enter the associated Azure AD client IDs here. Note that it may take up to 16 hours for these changes to take effect.\n\nFor more info, see [View and grant products from a service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt609002).\n\n## App management\n\nThe **App management** section lets you view identity and package details and manage your app's names.\n\n### App identity\n\nThis page shows you details related to your app's unique identity within the Store, including the URL(s) to link to your app's listing.\n\nFor more info, see [View app identity details](view-app-identity-details.md).\n\n### Manage app names\n\nThis is where you can view all of the names that you've reserved for your app. You can reserve additional names here, or delete names you're no longer using.\n\nFor more info, see [Manage app names](manage-app-names.md).\n\n### Current packages\n\nThis page lets you view details related to all of your published packages.\n\n**Note**  You won't see any info here until after your app has been published.\n\nThe name, version, and architecture of each package is shown. Click **Details** to show additional info such as supported language, app capabilities, and file sizes.\n\nThe exact info you see for each package may differ depending on its targeted operating system and other factors. For example, if you've added [Windows ad mediation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt219691) into your package, you'll find a link to configure mediation for that package here.\n\nDevelopers with OEM permissions can also [generate preinstall packages](generate-preinstall-packages-for-oems.md) from the **Current packages** page.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
