The system resumes your app whenever the user switches back to it. When the system resumes your app, the content of your variables and data structures is the same as it was before the system suspended the app. The system restores the app exactly where it left off, so that it appears to the user as if it's been running in the background. However, the app may have been suspended for a significant amount of time, so it should refresh any displayed content that might have changed while the app was suspended, such as news feeds or the user's location.\n\nIf your app doesn't have any displayed content to refresh, there's no need for it to handle the [**Resuming**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242339) event.\n\n**A note about debugging using Visual Studio:  ** When your app is attached to the Visual Studio debugger, you can send it a **Resume** event.

Then choose **Resume**.\n\n> **Note**  For Windows Phone Store apps, the [**Resuming**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242339) event is always followed by [**OnLaunched**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242335), even when your app is currently suspended and the user re-launches your app from a primary tile or app list.
