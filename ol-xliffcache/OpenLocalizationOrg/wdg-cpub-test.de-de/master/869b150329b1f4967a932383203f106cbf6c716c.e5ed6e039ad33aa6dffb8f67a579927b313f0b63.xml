need to map platform features—and your knowledge—between the three platforms.\n\nAlso see the porting content in [Move from iOS to UWP](ios-to-uwp-root.md).\n\n## User-interface (UI)\n\n|  **General concept** | **Android** | **iOS** | **Windows 10 UWP** |\n|  ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n|  **Design language.** A set of conventions that prescribe how apps on the platform should look and behave. | **Android Material Design** guidelines provide a visual language for Android designers and developers to follow. | **Human Interface Guidelines** provide advice for iOS designers and developers. | [**UWP Windows Apps Design**](https://dev.windows.com/design) shows you how to create an app that looks fantastic on all Windows 10 devices. You will find user-interface (UI) design fundamentals, responsive design techniques, and a full list of detailed guidelines.<br/> |\n|  **User interface markup language.** A markup language that renders and describes a UI and its components. Each platform provides an editor for both visual and markup editing.<br/> | **XML layouts**, edited using **Android Studio** or **Eclipse**. | **XIB** and **Storyboards** edited using **Interface Builder** inside Xcode. | **[XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt185595.aspx)**, edited using **[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/)** and **[Blend for Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj171012.aspx)**.<br/><br/>[XAML platform](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228259.aspx)<br/><br/>[Create a UI with XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228349.aspx)<br/><br/>[Define Layouts with XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228350.aspx) |\n|  **Built-in user interface controls.** Reusable UI elements provided by the platform such as buttons, list controls, and text controls. | Prebuilt **view** and **view group** classes referred to as widgets, layouts, text fields, containers, date/time controls and expert controls. | **Views** and **controls** found in the Xcode object library and listed in the UIKit user interface catalog. Views include image views, picker views and scroll views. Controls include buttons, date pickers and text fields. | The XAML platform provides you with a generous set of **built-in controls** such as buttons, list controls, panels, text controls, command bars, pickers, media, and inking.<br/><br/>[Add controls and handle events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228345.aspx) |\n|  **Control event-handling.** Defining the logic that runs when events are triggered within UI controls. | **Event handlers** and **event listeners** are added in XML or programmatically. | Controls send **action** messages to **targets**. | You can define methods to handle the events of a XAML control in a **code-behind file** attached to the XAML page. **Event handlers** are always written in code. But you can hook those handlers to events either in XAML markup or in code.<br/><br/>[Add controls and handle events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt228345.aspx)<br/><br/>[Events and routed events overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/mt185584.aspx) |\n|  **Data binding.** A software design pattern that allows your app UI to render data and optionally stay in sync with that data.  | There is a **Data Binding Library** provided, although it is still in beta. | No built-in bindings system exists on iOS. **Key-value observing** can be built upon to perform data binding, either with the use of a third-party library, or writing additional code. Controls use a delegate/callback approach for obtaining data. | The UWP platform handles **data binding** for you. You use the **[{x:Bind}](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt204783.aspx)** markup extension to take advantage of high performance binding or **[{Binding}](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt204782.aspx)** to take advantage of more features. It’s then just a case of configuring your binding to choose whether the platform uses **one-way binding** to display values from a data source in your UI, or whether it also observes those values and updates your UI when they change with **two-way binding**.<br/><br/>[Data Binding](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt210947.aspx) |\n|  **UI Automation.** Programmatic access to UI elements, making apps accessible to assistive technology products and enabling automated test scripts to interact with your UI. | **Text labels**, **contentDescription** and **hint** values help ensure UI elements can be found by automation. Android Studio allows you to write UI tests using the **UI Automator** and **Espresso** testing frameworks. | The **Automation instrument** allows you to write automated UI test scripts which identify elements using the **accessibility** settings or the element's position in the **element hierarchy**. | You get programmatic access to built-in UI elements in UWP out-of-box with **[UI Automation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/ee684076.aspx)**.<br/>**[Custom Automation Peers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt297667.aspx)** allow you to provide automation support for your own custom UI classes.
