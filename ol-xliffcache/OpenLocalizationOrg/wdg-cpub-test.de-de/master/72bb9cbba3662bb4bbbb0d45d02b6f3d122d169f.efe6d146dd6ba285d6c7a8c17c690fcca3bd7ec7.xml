bars (also called \"app bars\") provide users with easy access to your app's most common tasks, and can be used to show commands or options that are specific to the user's context, such as a photo selection or drawing mode. They can also be used for navigation among app pages or between app sections. Command bars can be used with any navigation pattern.\n\n![Example of a command bar with icons](images/controls_appbar_icons.png)\n\n<span class=\"sidebar_heading\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Important APIs</span>\n\n-   [**CommandBar **](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.commandbar.aspx)\n-    [**AppBarButton**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarbutton.aspx)\n-    [**AppBarToggleButton**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbartogglebutton.aspx)\n-    [**AppBarSeparator**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarseparator.aspx)\n\n## Is this the right control\n\nThe CommandBar control is a general-purpose, flexible, light-weight control that can display both complex content, such as images, progress bars, or text blocks, as well as simple commands such as [AppBarButton](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarbutton.aspx), [AppBarToggleButton](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbartogglebutton.aspx), and [AppBarSeparator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarseparator.aspx) controls.\n\nXAML provides both the AppBar control and the CommandBar control. You should use the AppBar only when you are upgrading a Universal Windows 8 app that uses the AppBar, and need to minimize changes. For new apps in Windows 10, we recommend using the CommandBar control instead. This document assumes you are using the CommandBar control.\n\n## Examples\nA command bar in the Microsoft Edge browser.\n\n![Command bar in Microsoft Edge browser](images/control-examples/command-bar-edge.png)\n\nA command bar in the Outlook Calendar on Windows Phone.\n\n![Command bar in Microsoft Edge browser](images/control-examples/command-bar-calendar-phone.png) \n\nAn inline command bar in the MediaTransportControls control template.\n\n![Command bar in Microsoft Edge browser](images/control-examples/command-bar-mtc.png)\n\n## Anatomy\n\nBy default, the command bar shows a row of icon buttons and a \"see more\" button, which is represented by an ellipsis \\[•••\\]. Here's the command bar created by the example code shown later. It's shown in its default, closed, compact state.\n\n![A closed command bar](images/command-bar-compact.png)\n\nThe command bar can also be shown in a closed, minimal state that looks like this. See the [Open and closed states](#open-and-closed-states) section for more info. \n\n![A closed command bar](images/command-bar-minimal.png)\n\nHere's the same command bar in its open state. The labels identify the main parts of the control.\n\n![A closed command bar](images/commandbar_anatomy_open.png)\n\nThe command bar is divided into 4 main areas:\n- The \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button is shown on the right of the bar, and is always visible. Pressing the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button has 2 effects: it reveals the labels on the primary command buttons, and it opens the overflow menu if any secondary commands are present.\n- The content area is aligned to the left side of the bar. It is shown if the Content property is populated.\n- The primary command area is aligned to the right side of the bar, next to the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button. It is shown if the PrimaryCommands property is populated.  \n- The overflow menu is shown only when the command bar is open and the SecondaryCommands property is populated.\n\nThe layout is reversed when the [FlowDirection]() is **RightToLeft**.\n\n## Create a command bar\nThis example creates the command bar shown previously.\n\n```xaml\n<CommandBar>\n    <AppBarToggleButton Icon=\"Shuffle\" Label=\"Shuffle\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\" />\n    <AppBarToggleButton Icon=\"RepeatAll\" Label=\"Repeat\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n    <AppBarSeparator/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Back\" Label=\"Back\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Stop\" Label=\"Stop\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Play\" Label=\"Play\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Forward\" Label=\"Forward\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n\n    <CommandBar.SecondaryCommands>\n        <AppBarButton Icon=\"Like\" Label=\"Like\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n        <AppBarButton Icon=\"Dislike\" Label=\"Dislike\" Click=\"AppBarButton_Click\"/>\n    </CommandBar.SecondaryCommands>\n\n    <CommandBar.Content>\n        <TextBlock Text=\"Now playing...\" Margin=\"12,14\"/>\n    </CommandBar.Content>\n</CommandBar>\n```\n\n## Commands and content\nThe CommandBar control has 3 properties you can use to add commands and content: [**PrimaryCommands**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.commandbar.primarycommands.aspx), [**SecondaryCommands**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.commandbar.secondarycommands.aspx), and [**Content**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.contentcontrol.content.aspx). \n\nGive visiblity to the actions in the command bar based on their priority.\n\n### Primary actions and overflow\n\nBy default, items you add to the command bar are added to the **PrimaryCommands** collection. These commands are shown to the left of the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button, in what we call the action space. Place the most important commands, the ones that you want to remain visible in the bar, in the action space. On the smallest screens (320 epx width), between 2-4 items will fit in the command bar's action space, depending on other on-screen UI.\n\nYou can add commands to the **SecondaryCommands** collection, and these items are shown in the overflow area. Place less important commands within the overflow area.\n\nThe default overflow area is styled to be distinct from the bar. You can adjust the styling by setting the [**CommandBarOverflowPresenterStyle**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.commandbar.commandbaroverflowpresenterstyle.aspx) property to a [Style](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.style.aspx) that targets the [**CommandBarOverflowPresenter**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.commandbaroverflowpresenter.aspx).\n\nYou can programmatically move commands between the PrimaryCommands and SecondaryCommands as needed. However, commands do not automatically move into or out of the overflow area as the command bar width changes.\n\n### App bar buttons\n\nBoth the PrimaryCommands and SecondaryCommands can be populated only with [**AppBarButton**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarbutton.aspx), [**AppBarToggleButton**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbartogglebutton.aspx), and [**AppBarSeparator**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarseparator.aspx) command elements. These controls are optimized for use in a command bar, and their appearance changes depending on whether the control is used in the action space or overflow area.\n\nThe app bar button controls are characterized by an icon and associated label. They have two sizes; normal and compact. By default, the text label is shown. When the [**IsCompact**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbarbutton.iscompact.aspx) property is set to **true**, the text label is hidden. When used in a CommandBar control, the command bar sets the button's IsCompact property automatically as the command bar is opened and closed.\n\nWhen you place an app bar button in the overflow menu (SecondaryCommands), it's shown as text only. Here's the same app bar toggle button shown in the action space as a primary command (top), and in the overflow area as a secondary command (bottom).\n\n![App bar button as primary and secondary command](images/app-bar-toggle-button-two-modes.png)\n\n- *If there is a command that would appear consistently across pages, it's best to keep that command in a consistent location.* \n- *We recommended placing Accept, Yes, and OK commands to the left of Reject, No, and Cancel. Consistency gives users the confidence to move around the system and helps them transfer their knowledge of app navigation from app to app.*\n\n### Other content\n\nYou can add any XAML elements to the content area by setting the **Content** property. If you want to add more than one element, you need to place them in a panel container and make the panel the single child of the Content property.\n\nWhen there are both primary commands and content, the primary commands take precedence and may cause the content to be clipped.\n\nWhen the [**ClosedDisplayMode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.closeddisplaymode.aspx) is **Compact**, the content can be clipped if it is larger than the compact size of the command bar. You should handle the [**Opening**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.opening.aspx) and [**Closed**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.closed.aspx) events to show or hide parts of the UI in the content area so that they aren't clipped. See the [Open and closed states](#open-and-closed-states) section for more info.\n\n### Labels and tooltips\n\nIf a text label for an app bar button is too long to fit on one line it will wrap to another line, increasing the overall height of the bar when it's opened. You can include a soft-hyphen character (0x00AD) in the text for a label to hint at the character boundary where a word break should occur. In XAML, you express this using an escape sequence, like this:\n\n```xaml\n<AppBarButton Icon=\"Back\" Label=\"Areally&#x00AD;longlabel\"/>\n```\n\nWhen the label wraps at the hinted location, it looks like this.\n\n![App bar button with wrapping label](images/app-bar-button-label-wrap.png)\n\nBecause text labels are hidden for command bar actions unless \"see more\" \\[•••\\] is pressed, consider using tooltips for action icons. This makes it easier for mouse users to discover your intent.\n\n## Open and closed states\n\nThe command bar can be open or closed. A user can switch between these states by pressing the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button. You can switch between them programmatically by setting the [**IsOpen**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.isopen.aspx) property. When open, the primary command buttons are shown with text labels and the overflow menu is open if secondary commands are present, as shown previously.\n\nYou can use the [**Opening**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.opening.aspx), [**Opened**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.opened.aspx), [**Closing**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.closing.aspx), and [**Closed**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.closed.aspx) events to respond to the command bar being opened or closed.  \n- The Opening and Closing events occur before the transition animation begins.\n- The Opened and Closed events occur after the transition completes.\n\nIn this example, the Opening and Closing events are used to change the opacity of the command bar. When the command bar is closed, it's semi-transparent so the app background shows through. When the command bar is opened, the command bar is made opaque so the user can focus on the commands.\n\n```xaml\n<CommandBar Opening=\"CommandBar_Opening\"\n            Closing=\"CommandBar_Closing\">\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Accept\" Label=\"Accept\"/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Edit\" Label=\"Edit\"/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Save\" Label=\"Save\"/>\n    <AppBarButton Icon=\"Cancel\" Label=\"Cancel\"/>\n</CommandBar>\n```\n\n```csharp\nprivate void CommandBar_Opening(object sender, object e)\n{\n    CommandBar cb = sender as CommandBar;\n    if (cb != null) cb.Background.Opacity = 1.0;\n}\n \nprivate void CommandBar_Closing(object sender, object e)\n{\n    CommandBar cb = sender as CommandBar;\n    if (cb != null) cb.Background.Opacity = 0.5;\n}\n\n```\n\n### ClosedDisplayMode\n\nYou can control how the command bar is shown in its closed state by setting the [**ClosedDisplayMode**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.closeddisplaymode.aspx) property. There are 3 closed display modes to choose from:\n- **Compact**: The default mode. Shows content, primary command icons without labels, and the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button.\n- **Minimal**: Shows only a thin bar that acts as the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button. The user can press anywhere on the bar to open it.\n- **Hidden**: The command bar is not shown when it's closed. This can be useful for showing contextual commands with an inline command bar. In this case, you must open the command bar programmatically by setting the **IsOpen** property or changing the ClosedDisplayMode to **Minimal** or **Compact**. \n\nHere, a command bar is used to hold simple formatting commands for a [RichEditBox](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.richeditbox.aspx). When the edit box doesn't have focus, the formatting commands can be distracting, so they're hidden. When the edit box is being used, the command bar's ClosedDisplayMode is changed to Compact so the formatting commands are visible.\n\n```xaml\n<StackPanel Width=\"300\" \n            GotFocus=\"EditStackPanel_GotFocus\" \n            LostFocus=\"EditStackPanel_LostFocus\">\n    <CommandBar x:Name=\"FormattingCommandBar\" ClosedDisplayMode=\"Hidden\">\n        <AppBarButton Icon=\"Bold\" Label=\"Bold\" ToolTipService.ToolTip=\"Bold\"/>\n        <AppBarButton Icon=\"Italic\" Label=\"Italic\" ToolTipService.ToolTip=\"Italic\"/>\n        <AppBarButton Icon=\"Underline\" Label=\"Underline\" ToolTipService.ToolTip=\"Underline\"/>\n    </CommandBar>\n    <RichEditBox Height=\"200\"/>\n</StackPanel>\n```\n\n```csharp\nprivate void EditStackPanel_GotFocus(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    FormattingCommandBar.ClosedDisplayMode = AppBarClosedDisplayMode.Compact;\n}\n\nprivate void EditStackPanel_LostFocus(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n{\n    FormattingCommandBar.ClosedDisplayMode = AppBarClosedDisplayMode.Hidden;\n}\n```\n\n>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of the editing commands is beyond the scope of this example. For more info, see the [RichEditBox](rich-edit-box.md) article.\n\nAlthough the Minimal and Hidden modes are useful in some situations, keep in mind that hiding all actions could confuse users.\n\nChanging the ClosedDisplayMode to provide more or less of a hint to the user affects the layout of surrounding elements. In contrast, when the CommandBar transitions between closed and open, it does not affect the layout of other elements.\n\n### IsSticky\n\nAfter opening the command bar, if the user interacts with the app anywhere outside of the control then by default the overflow menu is dismissed and the labels are hidden. Closing it in this way is called *light dismiss*. You can control how the bar is dismissed by setting the [**IsSticky**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.appbar.issticky.aspx) property. When the bar is sticky (`IsSticky=\"true\"`), it's not closed by a light dismiss gesture. The bar remains open until the user presses the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button or, if present, selects an item from the overflow menu.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Placement\n\nCommand bars can be placed at the top of the app window, at the bottom of the app window, and inline.\n\n![Example 1 of app bar placement](images/AppbarGuidelines_Placement1.png)\n\n-   For mobile devices, if you're placing just one command bar in your app, put it at the bottom of the screen for easy reachability. If your app has tabs on the bottom, consider placing the command bar at the top so that the UI isn't too bottom-heavy.\n-   For larger screens, if you're placing just one command bar, we recommend placing it at the top of the screen.\n-   You can also place command bars inline, so that people can use them for contextual actions.\n\nCommand bars can be placed in the following screen regions on single-view screens (left example) and on multi-view screens (right example). Inline command bars can be placed anywhere in the action space.\n\n![Example 2 of app bar placement](images/AppbarGuidelines_Placement2.png)\n\n>**Mobile Device Family**: If the command bar must remain visible to a user when the touch keyboard, or Soft Input Panel (SIP), appears then you can assign the command bar to the BottomAppBar property of a Page and it will move to remain visible when the SIP is present. Otherwise, you should place the command bar inline and positioned relative to your app content. Where you place the command bar will influence things like whether you make it sticky, or use the minimal mode when it's closed.\n\n### Actions\n\nPrioritize the actions that go in the command bar based on their visibility.\n\n-   Place the most important commands, the ones that you want to remain visible in the bar, in the first few slots of the action space. On the smallest screens (320 epx width), between 2-4 items will fit in the command bar's action space, depending on other on-screen UI.\n-   Place less-important commands later in the bar's action space or within the first few slots of the overflow area. These commands will be visible when the bar has enough screen real estate, but will fall into the overflow area's drop-down menu when there isn't enough room.\n-   Place the least-important commands within the overflow area. These commands will always appear in the drop-down menu.\n\nItems in the actions space can be visualized with either icons or buttons. When only using icons, include a text label. The text label appears under the icon when the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button is pressed.\n\nIf there is a command that would appear consistently across pages, it's best to keep that command in a consistent location. We recommended placing Accept, Yes, and OK commands to the left of Reject, No, and Cancel. Consistency gives users the confidence to move around the system and helps them transfer their knowledge of app navigation from app to app.\n\nAlthough you can place all actions within the overflow area so that only the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button is visible on the command bar, keep in mind that hiding all actions could confuse users.\n\n### Command bar flyouts and tooltips\n\nConsider logical groupings for the commands, such as placing Reply, Reply All, and Forward in a Respond menu.\n\n![Example of flyouts on a command bar](images/AppbarGuidelines_Flyouts.png)\n\nBecause text labels are hidden for command bar actions unless \\[•••\\] is selected, consider using tooltips for action icons.\n\n### Overflow menu\n\n![Example of command bar with \"More\" area](images/AppbarGuidelines_Illustration.png)\n\n-   The overflow menu is represented by the \"see more\" \\[•••\\] button, the visible entry point for the menu. It's on the far-right of the toolbar, adjacent to primary actions.\n-   Each action in the primary action space is represented by an icon. Selecting the overflow menu reveals text labels for each of the actions in the primary action space.\n-   The overflow area is allocated for actions that are less frequently used.\n-   Actions can come and go between the primary action space and the overflow menu at breakpoints. You can also designate actions to always remain in the primary action space regardless of screen or app window size.\n-   Infrequently used actions can remain in the overflow menu even when the app bar is expanded on larger screens.\n\n## Responsive guidance\n\n-   The same number of actions in the app bar should be visible in both portrait and landscape orientation, which reduces the user's cognitive load. The number of actions available should be determined by the device's width in portrait orientation.\n-   By targeting breakpoints, you can move actions in and out of the menu as the screen size or app window size changes.\n\n\n## Related articles\n\n**For designers**\n[Command design basics for UWP apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn958433)\n\n**For developers (XAML)**\n[**CommandBar**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn279427)\n\n"}
