Use the [**IsEnabled**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn631402) property, as required.\n\nRestricting the number of constraints serves to limit the amount of data that the speech recognizer needs to search and match against the speech input. This can improve both the performance and the accuracy of speech recognition.\n\nDecide which constraints are enabled based on the phrases that your app can expect in the context of the current recognition operation. For example, if the current app context is to display a color, you probably don't need to enable a constraint that recognizes the names of animals.\n\nTo prompt the user for what can be spoken, use the [**SpeechRecognizerUIOptions.AudiblePrompt**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn653235) and [**SpeechRecognizerUIOptions.ExampleText**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn653236) properties, which are set by means of the [**SpeechRecognizer.UIOptions**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn653254) property. Preparing users for what they can say during the recognition operation increases the likelihood that they will speak a phrase that can be matched to an active constraint.\n\n## <span id=\"related_topics\"></span>Related articles\n\n\n* [Speech interactions](speech-interactions.md)\n\n**Samples**\n* [Speech recognition and speech synthesis sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=619897)\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
