You can create custom Internet Explorer 11 packages in any of the languages your operating system version is available in.\n\n**Important**<br>Make sure that the language of your IEAK 11 installation matches the language of your custom IE11 package. If the languages don’t match, IEAK 11 won’t work properly.\n\n![](images/wedge.gif) **To use the Language Selection page**\n\n1.  Pick the language you want your custom IE11 installation package to use.<p>\nYou can support as many languages as you want, but each localized version must be in its own install package.<p>\n**Note**<br>To keep your settings across multiple versions of the package, you can pick the same destination folder for all versions. The different language versions are then saved in separate subfolders within that destination folder. Like, for an English version, `C:\\Cie\\Build1\\Flat\\Win32_WIN8\\en-US\\` and for a German version, `C:\\Cie\\Build1\\Flat\\Win32_WIN8\\de-DE\\`.\n\n2.
