**Health** report in the Windows Dev Center dashboard lets you get data related to the performance and quality of your app, including crashes and unresponsive events. You can view this data in your dashboard, or [download the report](download-analytic-reports.md) to view offline. Where applicable, you can view stack traces for further debugging.\n\n**Note**  If you had previously published apps and viewed performance data in the earlier dashboards, you may notice an increased number of crashes and events reported here. This is because we are able to include more data in this report to give you a more complete picture.\n\n \n\n## Apply filters\n\n\nNear the top of the page, you can expand **Apply filters** to filter all of the data on this page by date range and/or by package version.\n\n-   **Date**: The default filter is **Last 72 hours**, but you can expand this up to **Last 6 months**.\n-   **Package version**: The default setting is **All versions**.

(The default setting is to show all crash types.)\n\n## Market\n\n\nThe **Market** chart shows the total number of crashes and events over the selected period of time by market. By default, we show you the market which had the most acquisitions on top and continue downward from there. You can reverse this order by toggling the arrow in the **Crashes** column of this chart.\n\n## Failure log\n\n\nIf you have included PDB symbol files, the **Failure log** chart will show details related to occurrences of specific symbols, including the total number of crashes and the average daily number of crashes per symbol.\n\nThis info is based on a percentage of your total events.
