For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n** Important APIs\n\n-   [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn263413)\n-   [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.GenericAttributeProfile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn297685)\n\nThis article provides an overview of Bluetooth Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, along with sample code for three common GATT scenarios: retrieving Bluetooth data, controlling a Bluetooth LE thermometer device, and controlling the presentation of Bluetooth LE device data.\n\n## Overview\n\nDevelopers can use the APIs in the [**Windows.Devices.Bluetooth.GenericAttributeProfile**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn297685) namespace to access Bluetooth LE services, descriptors, and characteristics. Bluetooth LE devices expose their functionality through a collection of:\n\n-   Primary Services\n-   Included Services\n-   Characteristics\n-   Descriptors\n\nPrimary services define the functional contract of the LE device and contain a collection of characteristics that define the service. Those characteristics, in turn, contain descriptors that describe the characteristics.\n\nThe Bluetooth GATT APIs expose objects and functions, rather than access to the raw transport. At the driver level primary services are enumerated as Child Device Nodes of the Bluetooth LE device using the [**Windows.Devices.Enumeration**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR225459) APIs.\n\nThe Bluetooth GATT APIs also enable developers to work with Bluetooth LE devices with the ability to perform the following tasks:\n\n-   Perform Service / Characteristic / Descriptor discovery\n-   Read and Write Characteristic / Descriptor values\n-   Register a callback for the Characteristic ValueChanged event\n\nThe Bluetooth GATT APIs simplify development by dealing with common properties and providing reasonable defaults to aid in device management and configuration. They provide a means for developers to access functionality of a Bluetooth LE device from an app.\n\nTo create a useful implementation a developer has to have prior knowledge of the GATT services and characteristics the application intends to consume, and to process the specific characteristic values such that the binary data provided by the API is transformed into useful data before being presented to the user. The Bluetooth GATT APIs expose only the basic primitives required to communicate with a Bluetooth LE device. To interpret the data, an application profile must be defined, either by a Bluetooth SIG standard profile, or a custom profile implemented by a device vendor. A profile creates a binding contract between the application and the device, as to what the exchanged data represents and how to interpret it.\n\nFor convenience the Bluetooth SIG maintains a [list of public profiles](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=317977) available.\n\n## Retrieve Bluetooth data\n\nIn this example, the app consumes temperature measurements from a Bluetooth device that implements the Bluetooth LE Health Thermometer Service. The app specifies that it wants to be notified when a new temperature measurement is available. By registering an event handler for the \"Thermometer Characteristic Value Changed\" event, the app will receive characteristic value changed event notifications while it is running in the foreground.\n\nNote that when the app is suspended, it must release all device resources and when it resumes, it must perform device enumeration and initialization once again.\n\n```csharp\ndouble convertTemperatureData(byte[] temperatureData)\n{\n    // Read temperature data in IEEE 11703 floating point format\n    // temperatureData[0] contains flags about optional data - not used\n    UInt32 mantissa = ((UInt32)temperatureData[3] << 16) |\n        ((UInt32)temperatureData[2] << 8) |\n        ((UInt32)temperatureData[1]);\n\n    Int32 exponent = (Int32)temperatureData[4];\n\n    return mantissa * Math.Pow(10.0, exponent);\n}\n\nasync void Initialize()\n{\n    var themometerServices = await Windows.Devices.Enumeration\n        .DeviceInformation.FindAllAsync(GattDeviceService\n            .GetDeviceSelectorFromUuid(\n                GattServiceUuids.HealthThermometer),\n        null);\n\n    GattDeviceService firstThermometerService = await\n        GattDeviceService.FromIdAsync(themometerServices[0].Id);\n\n    serviceNameTextBlock.Text = \"Using service: \" + \n        themometerServices[0].Name;\n\n    GattCharacteristic thermometerCharacteristic =\n        firstThermometerService.GetCharacteristics(\n            GattCharacteristicUuids.TemperatureMeasurement)[0];\n\n    thermometerCharacteristic.ValueChanged += temperatureMeasurementChanged;\n\n    await thermometerCharacteristic\n        .WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync(\n            GattClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorValue.Notify);\n}\n\nvoid temperatureMeasurementChanged(\n    GattCharacteristic sender,\n    GattValueChangedEventArgs eventArgs)\n{\n    byte[] temperatureData = new byte[eventArgs.CharacteristicValue.Length];\n    Windows.Storage.Streams.DataReader.FromBuffer(\n        eventArgs.CharacteristicValue).ReadBytes(temperatureData);\n\n    var temperatureValue = convertTemperatureData(temperatureData);\n\n    temperatureTextBlock.Text = temperatureValue.ToString();\n}\n```\n\n```cpp\ndouble MainPage::ConvertTemperatureData(\n    const Array<unsigned char>^ temperatureData)\n{\n    unsigned mantissa = ((unsigned)temperatureData[3] << 16) |\n        ((unsigned)temperatureData[2] << 8) |\n        ((unsigned)temperatureData[1]);\n\n    int exponent = (int)temperatureData[4];\n\n    return mantissa * pow(10.0, (double)exponent);\n}\n\nvoid MainPage::Initialize()\n{\n    create_task(DeviceInformation::FindAllAsync(\n        GattDeviceService::GetDeviceSelectorFromUuid(\n            GattServiceUuids::HealthThermometer), \n        nullptr)).then(\n            [this] (DeviceInformationCollection^ thermometerServices) \n    {\n        create_task(GattDeviceService::FromIdAsync(\n            thermometerServices->GetAt(0)->Id))\n            .then([this] (GattDeviceService^ firstThermometerService) \n        {\n            GattCharacteristic^ thermometerCharacteristic = \n                firstThermometerService->GetCharacteristics(\n                    GattCharacteristicUuids::TemperatureMeasurement)\n                        ->GetAt(0);\n\n            thermometerCharacteristic->ValueChanged += \n                ref new TypedEventHandler<\n                    GattCharacteristic^, \n                    GattValueChangedEventArgs^>(\n                        this, &amp;MainPage::TemperatureMeasurementChanged);\n\n            create_task(thermometerCharacteristic->\n                WriteClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorAsync(\n                GattClientCharacteristicConfigurationDescriptorValue\n                    ::Notify));\n        });\n    });\n}\n\n\nvoid MainPage::TemperatureMeasurementChanged(\n    GattCharacteristic^ sender,\n    GattValueChangedEventArgs^ eventArgs)\n{\n    auto temperatureData =  ref new Array<unsigned char>(\n        eventArgs->CharacteristicValue->Length);\n    DataReader::FromBuffer(eventArgs->CharacteristicValue)\n        ->ReadBytes(temperatureData);\n\n    double temperatureValue = ConvertTemperatureData(temperatureData);\n    std::wstringstream str;\n    str << temperatureValue;\n\n    temperatureTextBlock->Text = ref new String(str.str().c_str());\n}\n```\n\n## Control a Bluetooth LE thermometer device\n\nIn this example, an UWP app acts as a controller for a fictitious Bluetooth LE Thermometer device.
