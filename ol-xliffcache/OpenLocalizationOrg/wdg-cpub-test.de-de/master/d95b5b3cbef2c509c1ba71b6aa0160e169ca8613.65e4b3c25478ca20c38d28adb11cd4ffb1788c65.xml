Go to the wdg-cpub-test repo on github.com and navigate to the readme.md file\n2. Make an update on the site to include this URL for msdnstage:\n    1. https://msdnstage.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/wdg-cpub-test/HelloWorld\n3. Request a pull change\n\n### 1.2a Use VS2015 to pull files from a repo\n\n1. Click the **Manage Connections** icon at the top of the **Team Explorer** window. You should see a GitHub section  (if this doesn't appear, you may need to sign in first). \n2. Click **Clone** and search for a project (eg *wdg-cpub*) from the list. Make sure it's going in your dedicated GitHub syncs folder. Click **Clone**.\n\nThis will pull all the files in the repo onto your local machine. Use File Explorer to go to the location of the repo and you can see the files. \n\nYou can copy the files to somewhere else on your machine to open them and play around with them without fear that you will make changes on the server.\n\n### 1.2b Use VS2015 to push files to a repo\n\nTo make changes appear on the server, open up the file from within your local folder and make the changes. Save the file and go back to VS2015.\n\nGenerally, you should make branches when you are making changes. See [Team Workflow for more information](https://msdnstage.redmond.corp.microsoft.com/en-us/wdg-cpub-test/tedhudek/workflow).\n\n1. Click the **Manage Connections** icon at the top of the **Team Explorer** window. You should see a GitHub section  (if this doesn't appear, you may need to sign in first). \n2. Double-click the repo you want to update in the list of **Local Git Respositories**. This will open the repo and take you to **Team Explorer**.\n3. Click **Branches**. right click on *master* and click *New local branch from...*.\n4. Enter a name for the new branch (describing what you did or the date maybe). Click **Create Branch**.\n5.

You have two options, which depend on whether you've created a repo on github.com already and want to use it, or if you want to create a new repo right now:\n    1. Under GitHub, click **Create**. Enter the name, a description, the local sync path you want to use (it's a good idea to keep all your syncs in one folder, on a non-OS partition). Click **Create**. In this example we'll use *Testing* for the name, and *F:\\Gits* for the path.\n    2. If you have an existing repo, click **Clone* and select it from the list. Click **Clone**.\n3. Your repo will appear in the list of **Local Git Respositories**. Double-click it to open the repo in **Team Explorer**.\n4. Under **Solutions** click **New...**.\n5.

It only contains a readme.md, but if you go to github.com, you'll see the repo has been created.\n\nNow you can start working on files. \n\nGo to the **Solution Explorer** in VS2015.
