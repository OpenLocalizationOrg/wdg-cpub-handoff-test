Windows Platform (UWP) apps\ndescription: In this guide, you'll learn about the technologies available for developing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) games.\nms.assetid: bc4d4648-0d6e-efbb-7608-80bd09decd6e\n---\n\n# Game technologies for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps\n\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nIn this guide, you'll learn about the technologies available for developing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) games.\n\n##  Benefits of Windows 10 for game development\n\n\nWith the introduction of UWP in Windows 10, your Windows 10 titles will be able to span all of the Microsoft platforms. With free migration from previous versions of Windows, there is a steadily increasing number of Windows 10 clients. The combination of these two things means that your Windows 10 titles will be able to reach a huge number of customers through the Windows Store.\n\nIn addition, Windows 10 offers many new features that are particularly beneficial to games:\n\n-   Reduced memory paging and reduced overall memory system size\n-   Improved graphics memory management actively allocates and protects more memory for the foreground game\n\n## UWP Games with C++ and DirectX\n\n\nReal-time games requiring high performance should make use of the DirectX APIs. DirectX is a collection of native APIs for creating games and multimedia applications that require high performance, such as 3D games. Because the DirectX APIs are native, C++ is the only language supported for use with DirectX.\n\n## Development Environment\n\n\nTo create games for UWP, you'll need to set up your development environment by installing a copy of Visual Studio 2015. Visual Studio 2015 allows you to create UWP apps and provides tools for game development:\n\n-   Visual Studio tools for DX game programming - Visual Studio provides tools for creating, editing, previewing, and exporting image, model, and shader resources. There are also tools that you can use to convert resources at build time and debug DirectX graphics code. For more information, see [Use Visual Studio tools for game programming](set-up-visual-studio-for-game-development.md).\n-   Visual Studio graphics diagnostics features - Graphics diagnostic tools are now available from within Windows as an optional feature. The diagnostic tools allow you to do graphics debugging, graphics frame analysis, and monitor GPU usage in real time. For more information, see [Use the DirectX runtime and Visual Studio graphics diagnostic features](use-the-directx-runtime-and-visual-studio-graphics-diagnostic-features.md).\n\nFor more information, see Prepare your Universal Windows Platform and DirectX game programming environment.\n\n## Getting Started with DirectX Game Project Templates\n\n\nAfter setting up you development environment, you can use one of the DirectX related project templates to create your UWP DirectX game. Visual Studio 2015 has three templates available for creating new UWP DirectX projects, **DirectX 11 App (Universal Windows)**, **DirectX 12 App (Universal Windows)**, and **DirectX 11 and XAML App (Universal Windows)**. For more information, see [Create a Universal Windows Platform and DirectX game project from a template](user-interface.md).\n\n## Windows 10 APIs\n\n\nWindows 10 provides a an extensive collection of APIs that are useful for game development. There are APIs for almost all aspects of games including, 3D Graphics, 2D Graphics, Audio, Input, Text Resources, User Interface, and networking.\n\nThere are many APIs related to game development, but not all games need to use all of the APIs. For example, some games will only use 3D graphics and only make use of Direct3D, some games may only use 2D graphics and only make use of Direct2D, and still other games may make use of both. The following diagram shows the game development related APIs grouped by functionality type.\n\n![game platform technologies](images/gameplatformtechnologies.png)\n\n-   3D Graphics - Windows 10 supports two 3D graphics API sets, Direct3D 11, and [Direct3D 12](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn899121). Both of these APIs provide the capability to create 3D and 2D graphics. Direct3D 11 and Direct3D 12 are not used together, but either can be used with any of the APIs in the 2D Graphics and UI group. For more information about using the graphics APIs in your game, see [Basic 3D graphics for DirectX games](an-introduction-to-3d-graphics-with-directx.md).\n\n    <table>\n    <colgroup>\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    <col width=\"50%\" />\n    </colgroup>\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"header\">\n    <th align=\"left\">API</th>\n    <th align=\"left\">Description</th>\n    </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr class=\"odd\">\n    <td align=\"left\">Direct3D 12</td>\n    <td align=\"left\"><p>Direct3D 12 introduces the next version of Direct3D, the 3D graphics API at the heart of DirectX.

For more information, see the [ID@Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/developers/id) page.\n\n##  Alternatives to writing games with DirectX and UWP\n\n\n### UWP Games without DirectX\n\nSimpler games with minimal performance requirements, such as card games or board games, can be written without DirectX and don't necessarily need to be written in C++. These sort of games can make use of any of the languages supported by UWP such as C#, Visual Basic, C++, and HTML/JavaScript. If performance and intensive graphics are not a requirement for your game, checkout [JavaScript and HTML5 touch game sample](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/JavaScript-and-HTML5-touch-d96f6031) as an example.\n\n### Game Engines\n\nAs an alternative to writing your own game engine using the Windows game development APIs, many high quality game engines that build on the Windows game development APIs are available for developing games on Windows platforms. When considering a game engine or library, you have multiple options:\n\n-   Full game engine - A full game engine encapsulates most or all of the Windows 10 APIs you would use when writing a game engine from scratch, such as graphics, audio, input, and networking. Full game engines may also provide game logic functionality such as artificial intelligence and pathfinding.\n-   Graphics engine - Graphics engines encapsulate the Windows 10 graphics APIs, manage graphics resources, and support a variety of model and world formats.\n-   Audio engine - Audio engines encapsulate the Windows 10 audio APIs, manage audio resources, and provide advanced audio processing and effects.\n-   Network engine - Network engines encapsulate Windows 10 networking APIs for adding peer-to-peer or server-based multiplayer support to your game, and may include advanced networking functionality to support large numbers of players.\n-   Artificial intelligence and pathfinding engine - AI and pathfinding engines provide a framework for controlling the behavior of agents in your game.\n-   Special purpose engines - A variety of additional engines exist for handling almost any game development related task you might run into, such as creating inventory systems and dialog trees.\n\n## Submitting a game to the Store\n\n\nOnce you’re ready to publish your game, you’ll need to create a developer account and submit your game to the Windows Store.\n\nFor information about submitting your game to the Windows Store, see <https://dev.windows.com/publish>.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}
