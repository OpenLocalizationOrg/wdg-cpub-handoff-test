For IT professional resources, like deploying Windows 10 or managing enterprise security features, see [Windows 10 on TechNet](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn986868).\n\n \n\n## Security\n\n\nWindows 10 provides a suite of security features for app developers to protect the identity of their users, the security of corporate networks, and any business data stored on devices. New for Windows 10 is Microsoft Passport, an easy-to-deploy two-factor password alternative that is accessible by using a PIN or Windows Hello, which provides enterprise grade security and supports fingerprint, facial, and iris based recognition.\n\n| Topic | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Intro to secure Windows app development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt622741) | This introductory article explains various Windows security features across the stages of authentication, data-in-flight, and data-at-rest. It also describes how you can integrate those stages into your apps. It covers a large range of topics, and is aimed primarily at helping app architects better understand the Windows features that make creating Universal Windows   Platform apps quick and easy. |\n| [Authentication and user identity](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt270184) | UWP apps have several options for user authentication which are outlined in this article. For the enterprise, the new Microsoft Passport feature is strongly recommended. Microsoft Passport replaces passwords with strong   two-factor authentication (2FA) by verifying existing credentials and by creating a device-specific credential that a biometric or PIN-based user gesture protects, resulting in a both convenient and highly secure experience. |\n| [Cryptography](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt270191) | The cryptography section provides an overview of the cryptography features available to UWP apps. Articles range from introductory walkthroughs on how to easily encrypt sensitive business data, to advanced to advanced topics such as manipulating cryptographic keys and working with MACs, hashes, and signatures. |\n\n \n\n## Data binding and databases\n\n\nData binding is a way for your app's UI to display data from an external source, such as a database, and optionally to stay in sync with that data. Data binding allows you to separate the concern of data from the concern of UI, and that results in a simpler conceptual model as well as better readability, testability, and maintainability of your app.\n\n| Topic | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Data binding overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt269383) | This topic shows you how to bind a control (or other UI element) to a   single item or bind an items control to a collection of items in a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. In addition, it shows how to control the rendering of items, implement a details view based on a selection, and convert data for display. |\n| [Entity Framework 7 for UWP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt592863) | Performing complex queries against large data sets is vastly simplified using Entity Framework 7, which supports UWP. In this walkthrough, you will build a UWP app that performs basic data access against a local SQLite   database using Entity Framework. |\n| [SQLite local database](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/A-Developers-Guide-to-Windows-10/10) | This video is a comprehensive developer's guide to using SQLite, the recommended solution for local app databases.
