machine to any Windows 10 Mobile device.\n---\n# Install apps with the WinAppDeployCmd.exe tool\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nWindows Application Deployment (WinAppDeployCmd.exe) is a command line tool that can use to deploy a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app from a Windows 10 machine to any Windows 10 Mobile device. You can use this tool to deploy an .appx package when the Windows 10 Mobile device is connected by USB or available on the same subnet without needing Microsoft Visual Studio or the solution for that app. This article describes how to install UWP apps using this tool.\n\nYou just need the Windows 10 SDK installed to run the WinAppDeployCmd tool from a command prompt or a script file. When you install an app with WinAppDeployCmd.exe, this uses the .appx file to side-load your app onto a Windows 10 Mobile device. This command does not install the certificate required for your app. To run the app, the Windows 10 Mobile device must be in developer mode or already have the certificate installed.\n\nBefore you can deploy your app to Windows 10 Mobile devices, you must create a package first. For more information, see \\[parent link here\\].\n\nThe **WinAppDeployCmd.exe** tool is located here on your Windows 10 machine: **C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Windows Kits\\\\10\\\\bin\\\\x86\\\\WinAppDeployCmd.exe** (based on your installation path for the SDK). First, connect your Windows 10 Mobile device to the same subnet or connect it directly to your Windows 10 machine with a USB connection. Then use the following syntax and examples of this command later in this article to deploy your .appx package:\n\n## WinAppDeployCmd syntax and options\n\nHere is the possible syntax that you can use for **WinAppDeployCmd.exe**\n\n``` syntax\nWinAppDeployCmd command -option <argument> ...\n    WinAppDeployCmd devices\n    WinAppDeployCmd devices <x>\n    WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -ip <address>\n    WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -guid <address> -pin <p>\n    WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -ip <address> -dependency <a> <b> ...\n    WinAppDeployCmd install -file <path> -guid <address> -dependency <a> <b> ...\n    WinAppDeployCmd uninstall -file <path>\n    WinAppDeployCmd uninstall -package <name>\n    WinAppDeployCmd update -file <path>\n    WinAppDeployCmd list -ip <address>\n    WinAppDeployCmd list -guid <address>\n```\n\nYou can install or uninstall an app on the target device, or you can update an app that's already installed. To keep data or settings saved by an app that's already installed, use the **update** options instead of the **install** options.\n\nThe following table describes the commands for **WinAppDeployCmd.exe**.\n\n|             |                                                                     |\n|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Command** | **Description**                                                     |\n| devices     | Show the list of available network devices.                         |\n| install     | Install a UWP app package to the target device.                     |\n| update      | Update a UWP app that is already installed on the target device.    |\n| list        | Show the list of UWP apps installed on the specified target device. |\n| uninstall   | Uninstall the specified app package from the target device.         |\n\n \n\nThe following table describes the options for **WinAppDeployCmd.exe**\n\n|                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Command**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| -h (-help)       | Show the commands, options and arguments.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| -ip              | IP address of the target device.                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| -g (-guid)       | Unique identifier of the target device.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| -d (-dependency) | (Optional) Specifies the dependency path for each of the package dependencies.
