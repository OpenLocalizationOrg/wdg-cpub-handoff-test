The iOS bridge enables you to build Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps in Visual Studio 2015 using Objective-C code and iOS API libraries. You can also use the bridge to extend your Objective-C code with unique Windows 10 features like Cortana and Live Tiles.\n-   [Learn more about the Windows Bridge for iOS](https://dev.windows.com/bridges/ios)\n\n## Why Windows?\n\nAre you an iOS developer, wondering how to make the move to Windows 10 and the UWP?
