10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\nThis article discusses the use of certificates in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. Digital certificates are used in public key cryptography to bind a public key to a person, computer, or organization. The bound identities are most often used to authenticate one entity to another. For example, certificates are often used to authenticate a web server to a user and a user to a web server. You can create certificate requests and install or import issued certificates. You can also enroll a certificate in a certificate hierarchy.\n\n### Shared certificate stores\n\nUWP apps use the new isolationist application model introduced in Windows 8. In this model, apps run in low-level operating system construct, called an app container, that prohibits the app from accessing resources or files outside of itself unless explicitly permitted to do so. The following sections describe the implications this has on public key infrastructure (PKI).\n\n### Certificate storage per app container\n\nCertificates that are intended for use in a specific app container are stored in per user, per app container locations. An app running in an app container has write access to only its own certificate storage. If the application adds certificates to any of its stores, these certificates cannot be read by other apps. If an app is uninstalled, any certificates specific to it are also removed. An app also has read access to local machine certificate stores other than the MY and REQUEST store.\n\n### Cache\n\nEach app container has an isolated cache in which it can store issuer certificates needed for validation, certificate revocation lists (CRL), and online certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.\n\n### Shared certificates and keys\n\nWhen a smart card is inserted into a reader, the certificates and keys contained on the card are propagated to the user MY store where they can be shared by any full-trust application the user is running. By default, however, app containers do not have access to the per user MY store.\n\nTo address this issue and enable groups of principals to access groups of resources, the app container isolation model supports the capabilities concept. A capability allows an app container process to access a specific resource. The sharedUserCertificates capability grants an app container read access to the certificates and keys contained in the user MY store and the Smart Card Trusted Roots store. The capability does not grant read access to the user REQUEST store.\n\nYou specify the sharedUserCertificates capability in the manifest as shown in the following example.\n\n```xml\n<Capabilities>\n    <Capability Name=\"sharedUserCertificates\" />\n</Capabilities>\n```\n\n## Certificate fields\n\n\nThe X.509 public key certificate standard has been revised over time. Each successive version of the data structure has retained the fields that existed in the previous versions and added more, as shown in the following illustration.\n\n![x.509 certificate versions 1, 2, and 3](images/x509certificateversions.png)\n\nSome of these fields and extensions can be specified directly when you use the [**CertificateRequestProperties**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br212079) class to create a certificate request. Most cannot. These fields can be filled by the issuing authority or they can be left blank. For more information about the fields, see the following sections:\n\n### Version 1 fields\n\n| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Version             | Specifies the version number of the encoded certificate.
