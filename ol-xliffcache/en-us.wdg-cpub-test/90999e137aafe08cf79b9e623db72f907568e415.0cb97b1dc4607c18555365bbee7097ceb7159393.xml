control that allows text search with a list of suggestions, then choose an auto-suggest box.\n\nFor more info about choosing the right text control, see the [Text controls](text-controls.md) article.\n\n## Examples\n\nAn auto suggest box in the Groove Music app.\n\n![An auto suggest box in the Groove Music app](images/control-examples/auto-suggest-box-groove.png)\n\n## Anatomy\nThe entry point for the auto-suggest box consists of an optional header and a text box with optional hint text:\n\n![Example of the entry point for auto-suggest control](images/controls_autosuggest_entrypoint.png)\n\nThe auto-suggest results list populates automatically once the user starts to enter text. The results list can appear above or below the text entry box. A \"clear all\" button appears:\n\n![Example of the expanded auto-suggest control](images/controls_autosuggest_expanded01.png)\n\n## Create an auto-suggest box\n\nTo use an AutoSuggestBox, you need to respond to 3 user actions.\n\n- Text changed - When the user enters text, update the suggestion list.\n- Suggestion chosen - When the user chooses a suggestion in the suggestion list, update the text box.\n- Query submitted - When the user submits a query, show the query results.\n\n### Text changed\n\nThe [**TextChanged**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox.textchanged.aspx) event occurs whenever the content of the text box is updated. Use the event args [Reason](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestboxtextchangedeventargs.reason.aspx) property to determine whether the change was due to user input. If the change reason is **UserInput**, filter your data based on the input. Then, set the filtered data as the [ItemsSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.itemssource.aspx) of the AutoSuggestBox to update the suggestion list.\n\nTo control how items are displayed in the suggestion list, you can use [DisplayMemberPath](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.displaymemberpath.aspx) or [ItemTemplate](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol.itemtemplate.aspx).\n\n- To display the text of a single property of your data item, set the DisplayMemberPath property to choose which property from your object to display in the suggestion list.\n- To define a custom look for each item in the list, use the ItemTemplate property.\n\n### Suggestion chosen\n\nWhen a user navigates through the suggestion list using the keyboard, you need to update the text in the text box to match.\n\nYou can set the [TextMemberPath](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox.textmemberpath.aspx) property to choose which property from your data object to display in the text box. If you specify a TextMemberPath, the text box is updated automatically. You should typically specify the same value for DisplayMemberPath and TextMemberPath so the text is the same in the suggestion list and the text box.\n\nIf you need to show more than a simple property, handle the [SuggestionChosen](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox.suggestionchosen.aspx) event to populate the text box with custom text based on the selected item.\n\n### Query submitted\n\nHandle the [QuerySubmitted](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox.querysubmitted.aspx) event to perform a query action appropriate to your app and show the result to the user.\n\nThe QuerySubmitted event occurs when a user commits a query string. The user can commit a query in one of these ways:\n- While the focus is in the text box, press Enter or click the query icon. The event args [ChosenSuggestion](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestboxquerysubmittedeventargs.chosensuggestion.aspx) property is **null**.\n- While the focus is in the suggestion list, press Enter, click, or tap an item. The event args ChosenSuggestion property contains the item that was selected from the list.\n\nIn all cases, the event args [QueryText](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestboxquerysubmittedeventargs.querytext.aspx) property contains the text from the text box. \n\n### Use AutoSuggestBox for search\n\nUse an AutoSuggestBox to provide a list of suggestions for a user to select from as they type.\n\nBy default, the text entry box doesn’t have a query button shown. You can set the [QueryIcon](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/xaml/windows.ui.xaml.controls.autosuggestbox.queryicon.aspx) property to add a button with the specified icon on the right side of the text box. For example, to make the AutoSuggestBox look like a typical search box, add a ‘find’ icon, like this.\n\n```xaml\n<AutoSuggestBox QueryIcon=\"Find\"/>\n```\n\nHere's an AutoSuggestBox with a 'find' icon.\n\n![Example of the entry point for auto-suggest control](images/controls_autosuggest_entrypoint.png)\n\n## Samples\n\nTo see a complete working examples of AutoSuggestBox, see the [AutoSuggestBox migration sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619996) and [XAML UI Basics sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619992).\n\nHere is a simple AutoSuggestBox with the required event handlers.\n\n```xaml\n<AutoSuggestBox PlaceholderText=\"Search\" QueryIcon=\"Find\" Width=\"200\"\n                TextChanged=\"AutoSuggestBox_TextChanged\"\n                QuerySubmitted=\"AutoSuggestBox_QuerySubmitted\"\n                SuggestionChosen=\"AutoSuggestBox_SuggestionChosen\"/>\n```\n\n```csharp\nprivate void AutoSuggestBox_TextChanged(AutoSuggestBox sender, AutoSuggestBoxTextChangedEventArgs args)\n{\n    // Only get results when it was a user typing, \n    // otherwise assume the value got filled in by TextMemberPath \n    // or the handler for SuggestionChosen.\n    if (args.Reason == AutoSuggestionBoxTextChangeReason.UserInput)\n    {\n        //Set the ItemsSource to be your filtered dataset\n        //sender.ItemsSource = dataset;\n    }\n}\n\n\nprivate void AutoSuggestBox_SuggestionChosen(AutoSuggestBox sender, AutoSuggestBoxSuggestionChosenEventArgs args)\n{\n    // Set sender.Text. You can use args.SelectedItem to build your text string.\n}\n\n\nprivate void AutoSuggestBox_QuerySubmitted(AutoSuggestBox sender, AutoSuggestBoxQuerySubmittedEventArgs args)\n{\n    if (args.ChosenSuggestion != null)\n    {\n        // User selected an item from the suggestion list, take an action on it here.\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // Use args.QueryText to determine what to do.\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Recommendations\n\n-   When using the auto-suggest box to perform searches and no search results exist for the entered text, display a single-line \"No results\" message as the result so that users know their search request executed:\n\n    ![Example of an auto suggest box with no search results](images/controls_autosuggest_noresults.png)\n\n\n## Related articles\n\n- [Text controls](text-controls.md)\n- [Spell checking](spell-checking-and-prediction.md)\n- [Search](search.md)\n- [**TextBox class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br209683)\n- [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls PasswordBox class**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227519)\n- [String.Length property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.string.length(v=vs.110).aspx)\n"}
