You can view this data in your dashboard, or [download the report](download-analytic-reports.md) to view offline. Alternatively, you can programmatically retrieve this data by using the [Windows Store analytics REST API](../monetize/access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md).\n\n> **Note**  You can also [respond to customer reviews](respond-to-customer-reviews.md) from this page.\n\nThis report shows the number of stars that a customer rated your app when leaving a review, but does not analyze star ratings across your app; for statistics about your ratings, see the [Ratings report](ratings-report.md).\n\nNote that customers can leave a rating for your app without adding any comments, so you will typically see fewer reviews than ratings.
