For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\n\nApp icon assets, which appear in a variety of forms throughout the Windows 10 operating system, are the calling cards for your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. These guidelines detail where app icon assets appear in the system, and provide in-depth design tips on how to create the most polished icons.\n\n![windows 10 start and tiles](images/assetguidance01.jpg)\n\n## <span id=\"Adaptive_scaling\"></span><span id=\"adaptive_scaling\"></span><span id=\"ADAPTIVE_SCALING\"></span>Adaptive scaling\n\n\nFirst, a brief overview on adaptive scaling to better understand how scaling works with assets. Windows 10 introduces an evolution of the existing scaling model. In addition to scaling vector content, there is a unified set of scale factors that provides a consistent size for UI elements across a variety of screen sizes and display resolutions. The scale factors are also compatible with the scale factors of other operating systems such as iOS and Android, which makes it easier to share assets between these platforms.\n\nThe Store picks the assets to download based in part of the DPI of the device. Only the assets that best match the device are downloaded.\n\n## <span id=\"Tile_elements\"></span><span id=\"tile_elements\"></span><span id=\"TILE_ELEMENTS\"></span>Tile elements\n\n\nThe basic components of a Start tile consist of a back plate, an icon, a branding bar, margins, and an app title:\n\n![breakdown of tile elements](images/assetguidance02.png)\n\nThe branding bar at the bottom of a tile is where the app name, badging, and counter (if used) appear:\n\n![branding bar in tile](images/assetguidance03.png)\n\nThe height of the branding bar is based on the scale factor of the device on which it appears:\n\n| Scale factor | Pixels |\n|--------------|--------|\n| 100%         | 32     |\n| 125%         | 40     |\n| 150%         | 48     |\n| 200%         | 64     |\n| 400%         | 128    |\n\n \n\nThe system sets tile margins and cannot be modified. Most content appears inside the margins, as seen in this example:\n\n![tile margins](images/assetguidance04.png)\n\nMargin width is based on the scale factor of the device on which it appears:\n\n| Scale factor | Pixels |\n|--------------|--------|\n| 100%         | 8      |\n| 125%         | 10     |\n| 150%         | 12     |\n| 200%         | 16     |\n| 400%         | 32     |\n\n \n\n## <span id=\"Tile_assets\"></span><span id=\"tile_assets\"></span><span id=\"TILE_ASSETS\"></span>Tile assets\n\n\nEach tile asset is the same size as the tile on which it is placed. You can brand your app's tiles with two different representations of an asset:\n\n1. An icon or logo centered with padding. This lets the back plate color show through:\n\n![tile and back plate](images/assetguidance05.png)\n\n2. A full-bleed, branded tile without padding:\n\n![tile showing full bleed](images/assetguidance06.png)\n\nFor consistency across devices, each tile size (small, medium, wide, and large) has its own sizing relationship. In order to achieve a consistent icon placement across tiles, we recommend a few basic padding guidelines for the following tile sizes. The area where the two purple overlays intersect represents the ideal footprint for an icon. Although icons won't always fit inside the footprint, the visual volume of an icon should be roughly equivalent to the provided examples.\n\nSmall tile sizing:\n\n![small tile sizing example](images/assetguidance07a.png)\n\nMedium tile sizing:\n\n![medium tile sizing example](images/assetguidance07b.png)\n\nWide tile sizing:\n\n![wide tile sizing example](images/assetguidance07c.png)\n\nLarge tile sizing:\n\n![large tile sizing example](images/assetguidance07d.png)\n\nIn this example, the icon is too large for the tile:\n\n![icon too big for tile](images/assetguidance08a.png)\n\nIn this example, the icon is too small for the tile:\n\n![icon too small for tile](images/assetguidance08b.png)\n\nThe following padding ratios are optimal for horizontally or vertically oriented icons.\n\nFor small tiles, limit the icon width and height to 66% of the tile size:\n\n![small tile sizing ratios](images/assetguidance09.png)\n\nFor medium tiles, limit the icon width to 66% and height to 50% of tile size. This prevents overlapping of elements in the branding bar:\n\n![medium tile sizing ratios](images/assetguidance10.png)\n\nFor wide tiles, limit the icon width to 66% and height to 50% of tile size. This prevents overlapping of elements in the branding bar:\n\n![wide tile sizing ratios](images/assetguidance11.png)\n\nFor large tiles, limit the icon width and height to 50% of tile size:\n\n![large tile size ratios](images/assetguidance12.png)\n\nSome icons are designed to be horizontally or vertically oriented, while others have more complex shapes that prevent them from fitting squarely within the target dimensions. Icons that appear to be centered can be weighted to one side. In this case, parts of an icon may hang outside the recommended footprint, provided it occupies the same visual weight as a squarely fitted icon:\n\n![three centered icons](images/assetguidance13.png)\n\nWith full-bleed assets, take into account elements that interact within the margins and edges of the tiles. Maintain margins of at least 16% of the height or width of the tile. This percentage represents double the width of the margins at the smallest tile sizes:\n\n![full-bleed tile with margins](images/assetguidance14.png)\n\nIn this example, margins are too tight:\n\n![full bleed tile with margins that are too small](images/assetguidance15.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Tile_assets_in_list_views\"></span><span id=\"tile_assets_in_list_views\"></span><span id=\"TILE_ASSETS_IN_LIST_VIEWS\"></span>Tile assets in list views\n\n\nTiles can also appear in a list view. Sizing guidelines for tile assets that appear in list views are a bit different than tile assets previously outlined. This section details those sizing specifics.\n\n![tile assets in a list view](images/assetguidance16.png)\n\nLimit icon width and height to 75% of the tile size:\n\n![sizing of icon of list view tile](images/assetguidance17.png)\n\nFor vertical and horizontal icon formats, limit width and height to 75% of the tile size:\n\n![sizing of icon of list view tile](images/assetguidance18.png)\n\nFor full bleed artwork of important brand elements, maintain margins of at least 12.5%:\n\n![full-bleed artwork in list view tile](images/assetguidance19.png)\n\nIn this example, the icon is too big inside its tile:\n\n![icon that is too big for tile](images/assetguidance20a.png)\n\nIn this example, the icon is too small inside its tile:\n\n![icon that is too small for tile](images/assetguidance20b.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Target-based_assets\"></span><span id=\"target-based_assets\"></span><span id=\"TARGET-BASED_ASSETS\"></span>Target-based assets\n\n\nTarget-based assets are for icons and tiles that appear on the Windows taskbar, task view, ALT+TAB, snap-assist, and the lower-right corner of Start tiles. You don't have to add padding to these assets; Windows adds padding if needed. These assets should account for a minimum footprint of 16 pixels. Here's an example of these assets as they appear in icons on the Windows taskbar:\n\n![assets in windows taskbar](images/assetguidance21.png)\n\nAlthough these UI will use a target-based asset on top of a colored backplate by default, you may use a target-based unplated asset as well. Unplated assets should be created with the possibility that they may appear on various background colors:\n\n![unplated and plated assets](images/assetguidance22.png)\n\nThese are size recommendations for target-based assets, at 100% scale:\n\n![target-based asset sizing at 100% scale](images/assetguidance23.png)\n\n**Iconic template app assets**\n\nThe iconic template (also known as the \"IconWithBadge\" template) lets you display a small image in the center of the tile. Windows 10 supports the template on both phone and tablet/desktop. (Learn about creating iconic tiles in the [Special tile templates article](tiles-and-notifications-special-tile-templates-catalog.md).)\n\nApps that use the iconic template, such as Messaging, Phone, and Store, have target-based assets that can feature a badge (with the live counter). As with other target-based assets, no padding is needed. Iconic assets aren't part of the app manifest, but are part of a live tile payload. Assets are scaled to fit and centered within a 3:2 ratio container:\n\n![sizing for assets with and without badge](images/assetguidance24.png)\n\nFor square assets, automatic centering within the container occurs:\n\n![square asset sizing, with and without badge](images/assetguidance25.png)\n\nFor non-square assets, automatic horizontal/vertical centering and snapping to the width/height of the container occurs:\n\n![non-square asset sizing, with and without badge](images/assetguidance26a.png)\n\n![non-square asset sizing, with and without badge](images/assetguidance26b.png)\n\n## <span id=\"Splash_screen_assets\"></span><span id=\"splash_screen_assets\"></span><span id=\"SPLASH_SCREEN_ASSETS\"></span>Splash screen assets\n\n\nThe splash screen image can be given either as a direct path to an image file or as a resource. By using a resource reference, you can supply images of different scales so that Windows can choose the best size for the device and screen resolution. You can also supply high contrast images for accessibility and localized images to match different UI languages.\n\nIf you open \"Package.appxmanifest\" in a text editor, the [**SplashScreen**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211467) element appears as a child of the [**VisualElements**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br211471) element. The default splash screen markup in the manifest file looks like this in a text editor:\n\n```XML\n<uap:SplashScreen Image=\"Assets\\SplashScreen.png\" /></code></pre></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n```\n\nThe splash screen asset is centered by whichever device it appears on:\n\n![sizing of splash screen asset](images/assetguidance27.png)\n\n## <span id=\"High-contrast_assets\"></span><span id=\"high-contrast_assets\"></span><span id=\"HIGH-CONTRAST_ASSETS\"></span>High-contrast assets\n\n\nHigh-contrast mode makes use of separate sets of assets for high-contrast white (white background with black text) and high-contrast black (black background with white text). If you don't provide high-contrast assets for your app, standard assets will be used.\n\nIf your app's standard assets provide an acceptable viewing experience when rendered on a black-and-white background, then your app should look at least satisfactory in high-contrast mode. If your standard assets don't afford an acceptable viewing experience when rendered on a black-and-white background, consider specifically including high-contrast assets. These examples illustrate the two types of high-contrast assets:\n\n![high-contrast ratio asset examples](images/assetguidance28.png)\n\nIf you decide to provide high-contrast assets, you need to include both sets—both white-on-black and black-on-white. When including these assets in your package, you could create a \"contrast-black\" folder for white-on-black assets, and a \"contrast-white\" folder for black-on-white assets.\n\n## <span id=\"Asset_size_tables\"></span><span id=\"asset_size_tables\"></span><span id=\"ASSET_SIZE_TABLES\"></span>Asset size tables\n\n\nAt a bare minimum, we strongly recommend that you provide assets for the 100, 200, and 400 scale factors.

Assets either get plated by the system or come with their own background color if the app includes that.\n-   File name format: \\*AppList.scale-\\*.PNG\n-   Impacted apps: Every UWP app\n-   Uses:\n    -   Start all apps list (desktop)\n    -   Start most-frequently used list (desktop)\n    -   Task manager (desktop)\n    -   Cortana search results\n    -   Start all apps list (mobile)\n    -   Settings\n\n**Target-size list assets with plate**\n\n-   These are fixed asset sizes that don't scale with plateaus. Mostly used for legacy experiences. Assets are checked by the system.\n-   File name format: \\*AppList.targetsize-\\*.PNG\n-   Impacted apps: Every UWP app\n-   Uses:\n    -   Start jump list (desktop)\n    -   Start lower corner of tile (desktop)\n    -   Shortcuts (desktop)\n    -   Control Panel (desktop)\n\n**Target-size list assets without plate**\n\n-   These are assets that don't get plated or scaled by the system.\n-   File name format: \\*AppList.targetsize-\\*\\_altform-unplated.PNG\n-   Impacted apps: Every UWP app\n-   Uses:\n    -   Taskbar and taskbar thumbnail (desktop)\n    -   Taskbar jumplist\n    -   Task view\n    -   ALT+TAB\n\n**File extension assets**\n\n-   These are assets specific to file extensions. They appear next to Win32-style file association icons in File Explorer and must be theme-agnostic. Sizing is different on desktop and mobile platforms.\n-   File name format: \\*LogoExtensions.targetsize-\\*.PNG\n-   Impacted apps: Music, Video, Photos, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Office\n-   Uses:\n    -   File Explorer\n    -   Cortana\n    -   Various UI surfaces (desktop)\n\n**Splash screen**\n\n-   The asset that appears on your app's splash screen. Automatically scales on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n-   File name format: \\*SplashScreen.screen-100.PNG\n-   Impacted apps: Every UWP app\n-   Uses:\n    -   App's splash screen\n\n**Iconic tile assets**\n\n-   These are assets for apps that make use of the iconic template.\n-   File name format: Not applicable\n-   Impacted apps: Messaging, Phone, Store, more\n-   Uses:\n    -   Iconic tile\n\n\\[This article contains information that is specific to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and Windows 10.
