(Internet Explorer Administration Kit 11 for IT Pros)\nms.sitesec: library\n---\n\n\n# Customize Automatic Search for Internet Explorer using IEAK 11\nInternet Explorer lets websites advertise any search provider that uses the open search standard described at the A9 website ( [OpenSearch 1.1 Draft 5](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=208582)). When IE detects new search providers, the **Search** box becomes active and adds the new providers to the drop-down list of providers.\n\nUsing the **Administrative Templates** section of Group Policy, you can prevent the search box from appearing, you can add a list of acceptable search providers, or you can restrict your employee’s ability to add or remove search providers.\n\n## Automatic Search Configuration\nYou can customize Automatic Search so that your employees can type a single word into the **Address** box to search for frequently used pages. For example, you can let a commonly used webpage about invoices appear if an employee types *invoice* into the **Address** box, even if the URL doesn’t include the term. If a website can’t be associated with the term, or if there are multiple matches, a webpage appears showing the top search results.\n\n![](images/wedge.gif) **To set up Automatic Search**\n\n1.  Create a script (.asp) file that conditionally looks for search terms, and post it to an intranet server here: http://ieautosearch/response.asp?MT=%1&srch=%2.<p>\nFor info about the acceptable values for the *%1* and *%2* parameters, see the [Automatic Search parameters](#automatic-search-parameters). For an example of the script file, see the [Sample Automatic Search script](#sample-automatic-search-script).<p>\n**Important**<br>If you aren’t using IIS in your company, you’ll need to remap this URL to your script file’s location. \n\n2.  On the **Additional Settings** page of the IEAK 11, click **Internet Settings**, and then click **Advanced Settings**.\n\n3.  Go to the section labeled **Searching** and type *intranet* into the **Search Provider Keyword** box.\n\n![](images/wedge.gif) **To redirect to a different site than the one provided by the search results**\n\n-   In the **Advanced Settings** section, go to the section labeled **Searching** and change the **When searching from the address bar** setting to **Just go to the most likely site**.\n\n![](images/wedge.gif) **To disable Automatic Search**\n\n-   In the **Advanced Settings** section, go to the section labeled **Searching** and change the **When searching from the address bar** setting to **Do not search from the address bar**.\n\n### Automatic Search parameters\nYou must replace the Automatic Search script file parameters, *%1* and *%2* so they’re part of the actual URL.\n\n|Parameter |Value                                                   |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|1% |The text string typed by an employee into the **Address** bar. |\n|2% |The type of search chosen by an employee.
