It can support anything from a single, constrained utterance to a collection of more flexible, natural language utterances, all denoting the same intent.\n\nA VCD file defines one or more voice commands, each with a unique intent.\n\nThe target app can be launched in the foreground (the app takes focus and **Cortana** is dismissed) or activated in the background (**Cortana** retains focus but provides results from the app), depending on the complexity of the interaction.
