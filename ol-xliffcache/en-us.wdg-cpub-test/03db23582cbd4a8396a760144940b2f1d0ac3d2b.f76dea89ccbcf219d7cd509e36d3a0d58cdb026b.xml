Uninstallation instructions let your employees remove components, like files, registry entries, or shortcuts, through the **Uninstall or change a program** box. For details about .inf files, see [INF File Sections and Directives](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=327959).\n\n ![](images/wedge.gif) **To add uninstallation instructions to the .inf files**\n\n-   Open the Registry Editor (regedit.exe) and add these registry keys:\n```\nHKLM,SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\app-name,\"DisplayName\",,\"description\"\nHKLM,SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall\\app-name,\"UninstallString\",,\"command-line\"\n```\nWhere **\"description\"** is the name that shows up in the **Uninstall or change a program** box and **\"command-line\"** is the command that runs after the component is picked.\n<p>**Note**<br>\nMake sure your script removes the uninstallation registry key, too. Otherwise, the component name will continue to show up in the **Uninstall or change a program**.\n\n## Limitations\n.Inf files have limitations:\n\n-   You can't delete directories.\n\n-   You can't use **RenFiles** to move a file to a different location, it only lets you rename a file in its existing location. For detailed information, see [INF RenFiles Directive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=298508).\n\n-   You can't use **CopyFiles** to copy a file to another place on your hard drive, it can only copy files from the source disk to the destination directory. For information, see [INF CopyFiles Directive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=298510).\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n"}
