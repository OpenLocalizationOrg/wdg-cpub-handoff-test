To use this option, I/O Verification must be enabled on at least one driver.\n\n-   [Invariant MDL Checking for Driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh974662) (Windows 8)\n\n    The [Invariant MDL Checking for Driver](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh974662) option monitors how the driver handles invariant MDL buffers on a per-driver basis. This option detects illegal modification of invariant MDL buffers. To use this option, you must enable I/O Verification on at least one driver.\n\n-   [Power Framework Delay Fuzzing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh454184) (Windows 8)\n\n    When this option is active, Driver Verifier randomizes thread schedules to help flush out concurrency errors in the driver.\n\n-   [Stack Based Failure Injection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh974664) (Windows 8)\n\n    The [Stack Based Failure Injection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh974664) option injects resource failures in kernel-mode drivers. This option uses a special driver, KmAutoFail.sys, in conjunction with [Driver Verifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Ff545448) to penetrate driver error handling paths.\n\n    **Note**  You cannot combine [Stack Based Failure Injection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh974664) with [Low resources simulation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Ff548288).\n\n     \n\n<span id=\"Driver_Verifier_options_that_require_I_O_Verification\"></span><span id=\"driver_verifier_options_that_require_i_o_verification\"></span><span id=\"DRIVER_VERIFIER_OPTIONS_THAT_REQUIRE_I_O_VERIFICATION\"></span>Driver Verifier options that require I/O Verification\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are four options that require you to first enable [I/O Verification](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Ff548045).
