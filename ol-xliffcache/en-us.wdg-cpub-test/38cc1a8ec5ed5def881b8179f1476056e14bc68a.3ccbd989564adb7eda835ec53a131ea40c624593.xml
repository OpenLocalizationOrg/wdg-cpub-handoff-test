The improved compatibility provided by Enterprise Mode can help give customers confidence to upgrade to the latest version of IE. In particular, IE11 lets customers benefit from modern web standards, increased performance, improved security, and better reliability.\n\n## Enterprise Mode features\n\nEnterprise Mode includes the following features:\n\n-   **Improved web app and website compatibility.** Through improved emulation, Enterprise Mode lets many legacy web apps run unmodified on IE11, supporting a number of site patterns that aren’t currently supported by existing document modes.\n\n-   **Tool-based management for website lists.** Use the Enterprise Mode Site List Manager to add website domains and domain paths and to specify whether a site renders using Enterprise Mode. <p>\nDownload the [Enterprise Mode Site List Manager (schema v.2)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=716853) or the [Enterprise Mode Site List Manager (schema v.1)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=394378), based on your operating system and schema.\n\n-   **Centralized control.** You can specify the websites or web apps to interpret using Enterprise Mode, through an XML file on a website or stored locally. Domains and paths within those domains can be treated differently, allowing granular control.
