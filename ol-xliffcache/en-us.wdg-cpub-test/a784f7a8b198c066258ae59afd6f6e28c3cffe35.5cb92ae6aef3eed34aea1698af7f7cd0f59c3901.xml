Guidelines for targeting\n\n\n\\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \\]\n\nTouch targeting in Windows uses the full contact area of each finger that is detected by a touch digitizer. The larger, more complex set of input data reported by the digitizer is used to increase precision when determining the user's intended (or most likely) target.\n\n**Important APIs**\n\n-   [**Windows.UI.Core**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br208383)\n-   [**Windows.UI.Input**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242084)\n-   [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Input**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br227994)\n\n\n\nThis topic describes the use of contact geometry for touch targeting and provides best practices for targeting in UWP apps.\n\n## <span id=\"Measurements_and_scaling\"></span><span id=\"measurements_and_scaling\"></span><span id=\"MEASUREMENTS_AND_SCALING\"></span>Measurements and scaling\n\n\nTo remain consistent across different screen sizes and pixel densities, all target sizes are represented in physical units (millimeters). Physical units can be converted to pixels by using the following equation:\n\nPixels = Pixel Density × Measurement\n\nThe following example uses this formula to calculate the pixel size of a 9 mm target on a 135 pixel per inch (PPI) display at a 1x scaling plateau:\n\nPixels = 135 PPI × 9 mm\n\nPixels = 135 PPI × (0.03937 inches per mm × 9 mm)\n\nPixels = 135 PPI × 0.35433 inches\n\nPixels = 48 pixels\n\nThis result must be adjusted according to each scaling plateau defined by the system.\n\n## <span id=\"Thresholds\"></span><span id=\"thresholds\"></span><span id=\"THRESHOLDS\"></span>Thresholds\n\n\nDistance and time thresholds may be used to determine the outcome of an interaction.\n\nFor example, when a touch-down is detected, a tap is registered if the object is dragged less than 2.7 mm from the touch-down point and the touch is lifted within 0.1 second or less of the touch-down. Moving the finger beyond this 2.7 mm threshold results in the object being dragged and either selected or moved (for more information, see [Guidelines for cross-slide](guidelines-for-cross-slide.md)). Depending on your app, holding the finger down for longer than 0.1 second may cause the system to perform a self-revealing interaction (for more information, see [Guidelines for visual feedback](guidelines-for-visualfeedback.md#selfreveal)).\n\n## <span id=\"Target_sizes\"></span><span id=\"target_sizes\"></span><span id=\"TARGET_SIZES\"></span>Target sizes\n\n\nIn general, set your touch target size to 9 mm square or greater (48x48 pixels on a 135 PPI display at a 1.0x scaling plateau). Avoid using touch targets that are less than 7 mm square.\n\nThe following diagram shows how target size is typically a combination of a visual target, actual target size, and any padding between the actual target and other potential targets.\n\n![diagram showing the recommended sizes for the visual target, actual target, and padding.](images/targeting-size.png)\n\nThe following table lists the minimum and recommended sizes for the components of a touch target.\n\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n<col width=\"33%\" />\n</colgroup>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th align=\"left\">Target component</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Minimum size</th>\n<th align=\"left\">Recommended size</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">Padding</td>\n<td align=\"left\">2 mm</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Not applicable.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">Visual target size</td>\n<td align=\"left\">&lt; 60% of actual size</td>\n<td align=\"left\">90-100% of actual size\n<p>Most users won't realize a visual target is touchable if it's less than 4.2 mm square (60% of the recommended minimum target size of 7 mm).</p></td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td align=\"left\">Actual target size</td>\n<td align=\"left\">7 mm square</td>\n<td align=\"left\">Greater than or equal to 9 mm square (48 x 48 px @ 1x)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td align=\"left\">Total target size</td>\n<td align=\"left\">11 x 11 mm (approximately 60 px: three 20-px grid units @ 1x)</td>\n<td align=\"left\">13.5 x 13.5 mm (72 x 72 px @ 1x)\n<p>This implies that the size of the actual target and padding combined should be larger than their respective minimums.</p></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n \n\nThese target size recommendations can be adjusted as required by your particular scenario. Some of the considerations that went into these recommendations include:\n\n-   Frequency of Touches: Consider making targets that are repeatedly or frequently pressed larger than the minimum size.\n-   Error Consequence: Targets that have severe consequences if touched in error should have greater padding and be placed further from the edge of the content area. This is especially true for targets that are touched frequently.\n-   Position in the content area\n-   Form factor and screen size\n-   Finger posture\n-   Touch visualizations\n-   Hardware and touch digitizers\n\n## <span id=\"Targeting_assistance\"></span><span id=\"targeting_assistance\"></span><span id=\"TARGETING_ASSISTANCE\"></span>Targeting assistance\n\n\nWindows provides targeting assistance to support scenarios where the minimum size or padding recommendations presented here are not applicable; for example, hyperlinks on a webpage, calendar controls, drop down lists and combo boxes, or text selection.\n\nThese targeting platform improvements and user interface behaviors work together with visual feedback (disambiguation UI) to improve user accuracy and confidence. For more information, see [Guidelines for visual feedback](guidelines-for-visualfeedback.md).\n\nIf a touchable element must be smaller than the recommended minimum target size, the following techniques can be used to minimize the targeting issues that result.\n\n## <span id=\"Tethering\"></span><span id=\"tethering\"></span><span id=\"TETHERING\"></span>Tethering\n\n\nTethering is a visual cue (a connector from a contact point to the bounding rectangle of an object) used to indicate to a user that they are connected to, and interacting with, an object even though the input contact isn't directly in contact with the object.
