UEFI update to enable additional security options for Surface Pro 3 devices.\n\nTo address more granular control over the security of Surface devices, the v3.11.760.0 UEFI update provides additional security options that allow you to disable specific hardware devices or to prevent starting from those devices. After the UEFI update is installed on a device, you can configure it manually or automatically by running a script.\n\n## Manually install the UEFI update\n\n\nBefore you can configure the advanced security features of your Surface device, you must first install the v3.11.760.0 UEFI update. This update is installed automatically if you receive your updates from Windows Update. For more information about how to configure Windows to update automatically by using Windows Update, see [How to configure and use Automatic Updates in Windows]( http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=618030).\n\nTo update the UEFI on Surface Pro 3, you can download and install the Surface UEFI updates as part of the Surface Pro 3 Firmware and Driver Pack. These firmware and driver packs are available from the [Surface Pro 3 page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=38826) on the Microsoft Download Center. You can find out more about the firmware and driver packs at [Download the latest firmware and drivers for Surface devices](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/surface/deploy-the-latest-firmware-and-drivers-for-surface-devices). The firmware and driver packs are available as both self-contained Windows Installer (.msi) and archive (.zip) formats. You can find out more about these two formats and how you can use them to update your drivers at [Manage Surface driver and firmware updates](https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/surface/manage-surface-pro-3-firmware-updates).\n\n## Manually configure additional security settings\n\n\n>**Note:**&nbsp;&nbsp;To enter firmware setup on a Surface device, begin with the device powered off, press and hold the **Volume Up** button, then press and release the **Power** button, then release the **Volume Up** button after the device has begun to boot.\n\nAfter the v3.11.760.0 UEFI update is installed on a Surface device, an additional UEFI menu named **Advanced Device Security** becomes available. If you click this menu, the following options are displayed:\n\n| Option         | Description                                                                                                                                                                          | Available settings (default listed in bold) |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Network Boot   | Enables or disables the ability of your Surface device to boot from the network (also known as PXE boot).                                                                            | **Enabled**, Not Bootable                   |\n| Side USB       | Enables or disables the USB port on the side of the Surface device.
