made up of a hierarchy of policy categories and subcategories that define how your policy settings appear in the Local Group Policy Editor, including:\n\n-   What registry locations correspond to each setting.\n\n-   What value options or restrictions are associated with each setting.\n\n-   The default value for many settings.\n\n-   Text explanations about each setting and the supported version of Internet Explorer.\n\nFor a conceptual overview of Administrative Templates, see [Managing Group Policy ADMX Files Step-by-Step Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=214519).\n\n## What are Administrative Templates?\nAdministrative Templates are XML-based, multi-language files that define the registry-based Group Policy settings in the Local Group Policy Editor. There are two types of Administrative Templates:\n\n-   **ADMX.** A language-neutral setup file that states the number and type of policy setting, and the location by category, as it shows up in the Local Group Policy Editor.\n\n-   **ADML.** A language-specific setup file that provides language-related information to the ADMX file. This file lets the policy setting show up in the right language in the Local Group Policy Editor. You can add new languages by adding new ADML files in the required language.\n\n## How do I store Administrative Templates?\nAs an admin, you can create a central store folder on your SYSVOL directory, named **PolicyDefinitions**. For example, %*SystemRoot*%\\\\PolicyDefinitions. This folder provides a single, centralized storage location for your Administrative Templates (both ADMX and ADML) files, so they can be used by your domain-based Group Policy Objects (GPOs).\n<p>**Important**<br>Your Group Policy tools use the ADMX files in your store, ignoring any local copies. For more information about creating a central store, see [Scenario 1: Editing the Local GPO Using ADMX Files](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=276810).\n\n## Administrative Templates-related Group Policy settings\nWhen you install Internet Explorer 11, it updates the local administrative files, Inetres.admx and Inetres.adml, both located in the **PolicyDefinitions** folder.\n<p>**Note**<br>You won't see the new policy settings if you try to view or edit your policy settings on a computer that isn't running IE11. To fix this, you can either install IE11, or you can copy the updated Inetres.admx and Inetres.adml files from another computer to the **PolicyDefinitions** folder on this computer.\n\nIE11 provides these new policy settings, which are editable in the Local Group Policy Editor, and appear in the following policy paths:\n\n-   Computer Configuration\\\\Administrative Templates\\\\Windows Components\\\\\n\n-   User Configuration\\\\Administrative Templates\\\\Windows Components\\\\\n\n\n|Catalog                                           |Description                                  |\n| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------|\n|IE                                                |Turns standard IE configuration on and off.  |\n|Internet Explorer\\Accelerators                    |Sets up and manages Accelerators.            |\n|Internet Explorer\\Administrator Approved Controls |Turns ActiveX controls on and off.           |\n|Internet Explorer\\Application Compatibility       |Turns the **Cut**, **Copy**, or **Paste** operations on or off.
